In this task, you're given reviews of various products in one of these languages 1) English 2) Japanese 3) German 4) French 5) Chinese 6) Spanish. Given a review, you need to predict whether the review is good or bad. A negative review is a bad review, and positive/neutral reviews are good reviews.\n\nEl paraguas es de muy mala calidad,da la sensaci\u00f3n que se va a romper cuando lo abres. Es muy cutre.\n",
        "response": "The review you provided is a negative review and would be classified as a bad review. It highlights several issues with the umbrella, including the potential for it to break when it is opened and it being poorly made. This would likely lead potential customers to avoid purchasing the product and instead opt for a higher-quality alternative that meets their needs and expectations. Therefore, this review would be classified as a bad review and would negatively impact the product's overall rating and potential sales."

Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin, rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812. His army walked through snow up to their knees and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone.
