At the party, the two are called upon to sing karaoke together (\"Start of Something New\"). They find that they have a connection and decide to exchange numbers before going their separate ways. One week after Christmas break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom, and she explains that she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico and transferred to East High School over the break. Troy shows Gabriella around the school, and they pause in front of the sign-up sheet for the winter musical auditions. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) arrives, assuming that Gabriella is interested in auditioning. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl and has the scholastic decathlon captain, Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past academic achievements, which results in Taylor and Gabriella becoming great friends. During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing more than basketball (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform (\"What I've Been Looking For\"), but both are too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late. After Mrs. Darbus attempts to leave, Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's composer, trips and drop her music sheets. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano (\"What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)\"). Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition. When the callback list is posted, Sharpay discovers that she has competition for the lead in the musical, and the rest of the Wildcats are shocked that Troy and...\nA:",

        "prompt": "Part 1. Definition\nIn this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words. Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n\nPart 2. Example\nContext word: fit. \nQuestion: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too large. \nAnswer: trophy.\nAnswer: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too small.\nExplanation: Here, replacing the trigger word \"large\" by its antonym \"small\" flips answer to the second object (\"suitcase\") in the question.

A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses.

To consider this as a donor-specific attribute, 20 random donor plasma samples were studied individually and identified a significant correlation between the RSV antibody titer and other respiratory virus titers: donors with high RSV titers were more likely to have higher titers to other respiratory viruses.

I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author\u2019s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation.

        "response": "user\n\nYou are a strategist for a political campaigner. \n\n\"I am currently a Lecturer in Social Policy in the Department of Applied Social Studies in Maynooth. I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author\u2019s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation.

        "prompt": "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: Passage: Nearing London, Oliver encounters Jack Dawkins, a pickpocket more commonly known by the nickname the \"Artful Dodger\", and his sidekick, a boy of a humorous nature named Charley Bates, but Oliver's innocent and trusting nature fails to see any dishonesty in their actions. The Dodger provides Oliver with a free meal and tells him of a gentleman in London who will \"give him lodgings for nothing, and never ask for change\". Grateful for the unexpected assistance, Oliver follows the Dodger to the \"old gentleman's\" residence. In this way Oliver unwittingly falls in with an infamous Jewish criminal known as Fagin, the gentleman of whom the Artful Dodger spoke. Ensnared, Oliver lives with Fagin and his gang of juvenile pickpockets in their lair at Saffron Hill for some time, unaware of their criminal occupations. He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs. \nQuestion: Who believes Fagin's gang make wallets and handkerchiefs?\nSolution: Oliver.\nExplanation: In the sentence \"He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs\", the pronoun \"he\" refers to name \"Oliver\".\n\nProblem: Passage: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \"seriously jeopardized financially\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad.  Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party.After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra's main conductor until his successor William Steinberg took up the post in 1959.  After the sudden resignation of Andrzej Panufnik from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959\u201360 season. That was his last chief conductorship, though he remained closely associated with the LPO as its president and a guest conductor until his retirement. \nQuestion: What is the name of the person that felt obligated to go to Russia?\nSolution:",

Context: WHITE HOUSE \u2014 An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \"zero-tolerance policy\" towards illegal immigrants. The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website.

He begins falling down a hill, while his head gets continually smashed by the force, eventually landing on his bottom.

Answer according to: Chris was the cutest boy I had ever laid eyes on and I was sitting right next to him in the back of his mom\u2019s station wagon. I remember it like yesterday. We were headed for the beach and someone started singing the song Jesus loves me. As a 13-year-old girl, I was completely taken aback by their pure glee and abandon as they sang. I truly believed that Jesus loved them, but was just as certain that there was no way He loved me. I thought going to church was a big waste of time. I believed in God, but wasn\u2019t sure about Jesus. Especially in my college years, I thought my parents were old and backwards and I was up and coming. When I argued with them about religion, my father would tell me how important it was to have faith in Christ. I wondered how someone as smart as my dad could believe in something so groundless. After marriage and especially after having kids, I began to contemplate the meaning of life. Was the meaning of life to be happy, avoid pain, make money, be nice to people, live somewhere beautiful? What was the point? I desperately needed to know the answer so I could guide my kids. I loved them so much and wanted more than anything in the world to teach them correctly. During the summers my children\u2019s preschool offered a two-week vacation bible school and I signed up to do art projects. As the co-leader read from the bible I helped the kids dip a big scaly fish from the meat department at Randall\u2019s into washable tempera paint and stamp its image onto a piece of construction paper. \u201cTaking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t know about the kids, but feeding 5,000 people with two fish and some bread was impressive. Jesus was not just meek & humble he was also powerful. But one night, soon after that conversation, I drove around and cried out to Jesus. I told Him that I wanted to believe in Him and that I was so sorry for all the things that I had done wrong. I asked Him to please forgive me and to take my life and make it His. First, the Lord led me to church and to study the Bible. By His grace, He helped me give up a cigarette habit. Then, He gave me a way to help people going through hardship via Stephen Ministry. He wooed my husband to attend church, strengthened our marriage and gave us a desire to give of our resources to God\u2019s work. He brought a Godly couple into our life to be mentors who connected us to ministries that reached out to high school kids and business professionals. He showed our children the way to find Him. Through the people at these ministries, God taught us how to pray and serve. He gave us Godly friends and brought us close to Himself. Most recently, the Lord provided an awesome missionary class called Perspectives and a mission trip to Haiti. It\u2019s been thirteen years since the Lord gave my life meaning and purpose. Life on earth is merely a story about God\u2019s glory.",

        "prompt": "[Question]Travis wants to fly to Australia. The regular tickets cost about $2000. As Travis is a student, he will get a 30% discount on this price. How much does he need to pay for his ticket?\n[Answer]The discount on the ticket is 30 / 100 * $2000 = $600. So Travis needs to pay $2000 - $600 = $1400. The answer is 1400.\nQ: Janet needs 5 tickets to ride the roller coaster and 3 tickets to ride the giant slide. How many tickets does she need to ride the roller coaster 7 times and the giant slide 4 times?\nA: First find how many tickets she needs for the roller coaster: 5 tickets / ride * 7 rides = 35 tickets. Then find how many tickets she needs for the giant slide: 3 tickets / ride * 4 rides = 12 tickets. Then add the number of tickets she needs for each ride to find the total number of tickets she needs: 12 tickets + 35 tickets = 47 tickets. The answer is 47.\nQuestion: Grace just started her own business. Each week, she charges 300 dollars. Grace's client will pay her every 2 weeks. How many weeks will it take for Grace to get 1800 dollars?\nAnswer: Every two weeks, Grace will get 300 * 2 = 600 dollars. It will take Grace 1800 / 600 = 3 2 - week intervals to get 1800 dollars. It will take Grace 3 * 2 = 6 weeks in total. The answer is 6.\n[Question]Willie came back from Europe with 70 euros. Normally 5 euros is worth 1 dollar, but the money exchange at the airport will only give Willie 5/7ths of the official exchange rate. How many dollars does Willie get?\n[Answer]First first out how many euros Willie should have gotten using the official exchange rate: 70 euros / 5 euros / dollar = $14. Then multiply this quantity by 5 / 7 to find how many dollars he actually got: 14 dollars * 5 / 7 = $2 * 5 = $10. The answer is 10.\nQ: In a store, there are three types of cheese: white, swiss, and blue cheese. Each cheese is packaged, and there are 200 grams of cheese in each package. The package prices are $5 for white cheese, $6 for swiss cheese, and $8 for blue cheese. Miley needed to get some for her party, and she decided to buy 5 packs of swiss cheese, 600 grams of blue cheese, and one-third less white cheese. How much did she need to pay for all the cheese?\nA: For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $30. 600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = 3 packages. So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $24. One - third of the blue cheese means 1 / 3 * 600 = 200 grams. So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = 400 grams of white cheese. Which means 400 / 200 = 2 packages. So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $10. So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $64. The answer is 64.\nQuestion: Timothy and Theresa go to the movies very often. Timothy went to the movies 7 more times in 2010 that he did in 2009.

He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh. 'Not that this isn't fascinating, but did you seriously call me out to Denny's at 3 am for this?' According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Passage:Howells was born on 11 May 1871 in Cwm, Monmouthshire in south Wales. He was educated at schools in Cwm and Pengam before winning a scholarship to Regent's Park Baptist College, London. After graduating with a degree awarded by the University of London, he studied at the University of Oxford (at Mansfield College and Jesus College), at Christ's College, Cambridge and at the University of T\u00fcbingen, obtaining degrees from a total of four universities. He travelled to India in 1895 for the Baptist Missionary Society to deal with literary and educational work. In 1907, he became Principal of Serampore College, a post he held until 1932. During this time, he also served as a Fellow and examiner of the University of Calcutta (1913 to 1929) and was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council in 1918. After returning to Britain in 1932, he was lecturer in Hebrew at Rawdon Baptist College until 1935. He received honorary degrees from the University of St Andrews, Serampore College and the University of Wales. During his retirement, he moved to Castleton, south Wales and he died on 7 November 1935.\n\n[EX A]: a\n\n[EX Q]: Question: How much was F\u00e9lix de los Heros' contract worth with the Brooklyn Hispano?

Late in 1936 he joined Gimn\u00e1stico de Valencia. In 1937, in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, he joined Barcelona FC. His first game for them was on the 16 May 1937 against the Catalan national team. He never actually played for them in the domestic league but participated in the Barcelona FC tour of North America later in 1937. When the tour ended he signed for Brooklyn Hispano, a United States team that played in the American Soccer League. Later he moved to Mexico where he played for Club Deportivo Euzkadi in the Primera Fuerza league for the 1938/39 season. He also played for the Basque Country national football team twice during that period. Later he joined Club Espa\u00f1a, before going on to play in several other Mexican teams.\n\n[EX A]: b\n\n[EX Q]: Question: What country was Munzinger sent to in July of 1870? Passage:After a short stay in Europe in 1863, Munzinger returned to the north and north-east borderlands of Ethiopia. In 1865 Munzinger managed the British consulate along the border of Ethiopia, but remained in Massawa, after the 1868 British invasion of Ethiopia, where he became the French consul. There, according to Augustus B. Wylde, he married a woman of Hamasien and convinced one of the local warlords, Wolde Mikael, to cede the province of Hamasien to France. Munzinger sailed to France, and by early 1870 had an expedition ready at Toulon to sail to Massawa when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and French resources were diverted to this higher priority, whereupon he left the service of the French. In July of that year he was sent to Aden, where he joined Captain S.B. Miles on an expedition into the interior of the southern Arabian peninsula. He then left the French and entered the service of the Egyptian government of Khedive Ismail, serving as governor of the Keren region and Massawa (modern-day Eritrea). Once he reached his command, his first act was to place the Bogos once again under Egyptian rule.\n\n[EX A]:",

Before his mother dies, she makes him promise that he will marry a woman as beautiful as The Virgin Mary. His father, Tetsu, becomes a devout Catholic priest following the death of Yu's mother, and operates his own church. As he grows up, Yu comes to realise that only marrying Mary will suit him, and goes on his search for Mary. A woman named Kaori becomes obsessed with Tetsu, and forces her love on him, which he eventually reciprocates. Together, the three move into a new house where their relationship is kept a secret. Tired of this secrecy, Kaori leaves the house, which leaves Tetsu broken and depressed. He makes Yu come to confessional every day, and demands to know his sins. Yu, unable to think of any sins he might have committed, lies, but is caught. He decides to deliberately commit sins and confess them to his father.Tetsu becomes displeased with this, and moves to his church, almost disowning Yu as his son. Yu falls in with a gang of three delinquent boys named Takahiro, Yuji and Senpai, who teach him to steal, fight and live on the streets, amused by his need to commit sins only to confess them to his father.

How many Japanese stamps does Nikka have?\nAnd an answer: 45\nSo how you got the answer?\nNikka has 100 x 35 / 100 = 35 Chinese stamps. She has 100 x 20 / 100 = 20 US stamps. So, Nikka has 35 + 20 = 55 stamps that are not Japanese. Thus, Nikka has 100 - 55 = 45 Japanese stamps.\n\nWe have a question: Ben spends 20% of his after-tax income on his car. If his car payment is $400 and he pays 1/3 of his gross income in taxes, how much does he make per month before taxes?\nAnd an answer: 3000\nSo how you got the answer?\nFirst divide that amount of the car payment by 20% to find Ben's after - tax salary: $400 /.2 = $2000. Then find the proportion of his salary Ben keeps after taxes by subtracting the tax rate from 1: 1 - 1 / 3 = 2 / 3. Then divide Ben's after - tax salary by the proportion of his salary he keeps to find his before - tax salary: $2000 / 2 / 3 = $3000.\n\nWe have a question: Matt is playing basketball.

One potential implementation could be using the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on a text string, where the sentiment score can be used as a feature in further data analysis. This would require importing the library and utilizing the code snippet provided in the given prompt."

Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels.
