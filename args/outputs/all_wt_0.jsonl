        "prompt": "How does spaghetti squash compare to traditional pasta in terms of nutritional content and calorie count, and what are some potential health benefits? Generate according to: Golden yellow and oval shaped, spaghetti squash usually weighs about 4 to 8 pounds. When cooked, the inside looks just like spaghetti and can be prepared in the same way. A great way to get your veggies, spaghetti squash is rich in nutrients including potassium, vitamin A, beta carotene and folic acid and can be substituted for spaghetti in any pasta dish. It's lower in calories than pasta and not nearly as heavy so you don't feel like you've eaten too much afterwards as sometimes happens with pasta. Spaghetti squash can be served as a main course with marinara sauce and meatballs, just as you would serve spaghetti (pasta). Or, make it a side vegetable with roast beef, pork or fish. Toss it with butter for a simple side or add your own mixture of herbs and spices. It also adds a nice texture and color to any salad. When selecting a squash look for a pale yellow color with no bruises or soft spots. Avoid the ones that still have some green skin as they would not have matured yet. Spaghetti squash can be baked, boiled, steamed or microwaved. The skin of an uncooked squash is thick and tough making it difficult to peel (practically impossible) or cut with a knife. I find it's easiest to bake it whole. Using a fork remove the spaghetti strands, they separate easily. Serve your spaghetti squash in any of these colorful dishes. A touch of Italy or beautiful Mexico inspired bright tones. Keep it simple with images of vegetables and herbs. Use them for soup, cereal, salad...anything at all! These Pyrex baking dishes are just what you'll need for spaghetti squash. They can go in the oven, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and microwave. Use them for baking cakes, lasagna, casseroles and lots more. It's lighter than pasta but can be served with the same sauces you would use for spaghetti. Spaghetti squash salad is a great idea! I'll experiment with that. I drink water with meals, but I suppose white or red wine would be nice depending on the sauce. candy47, Do you have any spaghetti squash salad recipes? What do you serve for drinks with your fresh and heated versions? I'm glad you had a pleasant memory Brenda marie. Yes MBC, healthier and lighter than pasta. You don't feel 'heavy' after eating spaghetti squash. I love spaghetti Squash! And it's healthier than pasta. I've had spaghetti squash a few times - it's definitely a vegetable version of spaghetti! Happy that this article reminded me it's in season again right now. Ideal for small living spaces or limited outdoor planting areas, indoor herb gardens will provide freshly picked herbs all year round.",

And yet, they were also running towards them, hacking away with their sword at any that came too close. The decayed army was slowly closing in on them on all sides. Yet, Alear kept running.\nSuddenly, a floating man in royal blue garb had seemingly caught up with them. He filled the empty space beside them that they didn\u2019t know was there.\n\u201cAlmost time,\u201d he said just loud enough for Alear to hear. He wasn\u2019t there before, but it was like he never left.\nKeep running.\nMore ashy soldiers were getting too close for comfort. Alear prepared their blade to cut them aside. But before they could swing, a strong gust of wind swept the pursuers away. No, that wasn\u2019t a normal gust of wind. They glanced at where it came from to find an elegant young woman shaking off wispy wind residue from her hands.\n\u201cWe can handle this,\u201d was all she said, before turning back to prepare another spell. A green apparition wielding a bow, appeared beside her, ready to assist the mage as she blew the ashy army away.\nKeep running.\nAlear rushed past a burly young man cloaked in vermillion and another young woman dressed in colorful clothing and beads, both beating down frigid animate armor with sword and spear respectively, as well as the assistance of their own apparitions. They said something, but Alear couldn\u2019t quite make it out over the noise.\nDoesn\u2019t matter. Keep running.\nA young blonde man then came into their view, striking down any stray opponent that stood in Alear\u2019s way with a specter of his own.\n\u201cKeep going! You can do this!\u201d was what Alear heard from him. He was already out of their sight before they could ask what \u2018this\u2019 was. What was Alear supposed to do? They didn\u2019t really know, but at the same time, they knew exactly what they needed to do.\nThat was probably why Alear was still running. They ran pretty far, but now a door was in their way. They put their claws upon it, noticing how a ring gleamed from one of their fingers. \nThey froze. \nThe ring was pretty.\nThe ring seem to have importance Alear couldn\u2019t recall.\nThe ring sparkled in the faint light.\nIt did not match the scaly claws it sat on.\nIt did not match the hideous hands that belonged to Alear.\nIt did not-\n\u201cAlear,\u201d\nThe man beside them suddenly spoke, reeling them from their spiral. That\u2019s right, there was still something they needed to do.\n\u201cOur final battle lies ahead,\u201d\nAlear remembered now. There was no use in dwelling on their appearance. Not until they were finished. Together with the blue phantom, they pushed the door open.\n\u201cNow. It\u2019s time to engage.\u201d\nThe two now in agreement rushed past the doors, feeling a new familiar pang of power giving them the strength to conquer their mighty foe that lies ahead.\nAnd they were running again.\n\nThe goal of this passage is to emphasize the main character (Alear) is experiencing a repeating dream.

We go \"jogging.\" In business, we attend a \"meeting\" and we have \"good connections.\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \"Americanization\". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich  , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice. However, there are some fields that require the use of English words, for example, in the high-tech communication and the Internet fields, there is no alternative to English. Also, I think sometimes I have to speak English when I introduce some scenic places to tourists. I think you have to find a balance and decide when it is better to use good German in place of bad English or when the use of correct English words is more suitable. Languages have always changed naturally, and I disagree with a restriction by law. Some nice expressions borrowed from other languages can make a conversation more vivid. Question: From the passage, we can learn that when Hitler was in power,   _   in Germany. Answer:\n\n (i) all languages except English could be used; (ii) only some foreign languages could be used; (iii) only the upper class could speak English; (iv) only the German language could be used;\nA:",

His mother never gave up on him and was determined to prove to the world that her child can be normal. As Cho-won gets older, he begins to find a passion for running and his mother is there to encourage and support him. Even though their family suffers from financial difficulties, they find a former marathon champion, Jung-wook \u00e2\u0080\u0094 now a lethargic older man with an alcohol problem.Jung-wook, who is serving community service hours as a physical education teacher for a DUI, grudgingly accepts the offer to train Cho-won in marathon running, but eventually becomes lazy with him. The coach often takes Cho-won's snack, and takes Cho-won to a jjimjilbang to relax. Even though Jung-wook slacks off most of the time, Cho-won's determination for running is firm (he accidentally runs 100 laps around a soccer field when the coach told him to without literally meaning it).He takes third place in a 10\u00c2\u00a0km running race, which causes his mother to set another goal for her son: to run a full marathon under three hours. This is not an easy task, however, as Cho-won wants to win but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to pace himself. Therefore, his mother pleads the coach to run with Cho-won in order to teach him how to pace his running.

His girlfriend Katie Jagger, his ex-wife Audrey Paris, and daughter Michelle try to pull him back from the brink, but it is too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique.Gideon's condition gets progressively worse. He is rushed to a hospital after experiencing chest pains during a particularly stressful table read (with the penny-pinching backers in attendance) and admitted with severe attacks of angina. Joe brushes off his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for three to four weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. The show is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, in brazen denial of his mortality. Champagne flows, endless strings of women frolic around his hospital room and the cigarettes are always lit. Cardiogram readings don't show any improvement as Gideon dances with death. As the negative reviews for his feature film (which has been released without him) come in, Gideon has a massive coronary and is taken straight to coronary artery bypass surgery.The backers for the show must then decide whether it's time to pack up or replace Gideon as the director. Their matter-of-fact money-oriented negotiations with the insurers are juxtaposed with graphic scenes of (presumably Joe's) open heart surgery. The producers realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon dying which would bring in a profit of over USD$500,000.

In particular, kudos to the quality of the sound reproduction, which I've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones.\nquestion: How bad is the sound?\nwhich I 've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones\n\nreview: The Prestige (2006)Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David BowieChristopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.\nquestion: What was an impeccable act?\nBale 's performance is superb and I think it 's the best of his career Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless .

        "prompt": "For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\n[EX Q]: Did M0 's director , cinematographer , costume designer , star , editor , and art director direct M1 and M2\n[EX A]: SELECT count(*) WHERE {\n?x0 ns:film.actor.film/ns:film.performance.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.cinematographer.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M1 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M2 .\n?x0 ns:film.editor.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.film_art_director.films_art_directed M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.film_costumer_designer.costume_design_for_film M0\n}\n\n[EX Q]: Did M5 's art director , director , and star write M0 , M1 , M2 , M3 , and M4\n[EX A]: SELECT count(*) WHERE {\n?x0 ns:film.actor.film/ns:film.performance.film M5 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M5 .\n?x0 ns:film.film_art_director.films_art_directed M5 .\n?x0 ns:film.writer.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.writer.film M1 .\n?x0 ns:film.writer.film M2 .\n?x0 ns:film.writer.film M3 .\n?x0 ns:film.writer.film M4\n}\n\n[EX Q]: Did M0 's producer , cinematographer , art director , writer , executive producer , and editor direct M1 and M2\n[EX A]:",

It has been proposed that\nattentional templates integrate target features (e.g., purple chair) to guide attention in an object-based\nfashion. Alternatively, it may be that attentional templates are established for each target feature individually (e.g., purple and chair). To provide support for the latter account, we used a task where participants memorized a target shape while ignoring an irrelevant color. In the combined condition, the shape\nwas shown in the irrelevant color. In the separate condition, the irrelevant color was spatially separate\nfrom the shape. After the initial presentation and a blank retention interval, participants were asked to\nmake a saccade to the initially viewed shape, which was shown together with a distractor. Attentional\nguidance by the irrelevant color was strongly reduced with separate presentation, suggesting that guidance is object-based. However, it may be that irrelevant color was less reliably encoded with separate\npresentation. Therefore, we asked participants to store the irrelevant color for later recall. With the additional memory task, guidance by irrelevant color occurred regardless of whether it was presented as part\nof an object or separately. Thus, effects of irrelevant features are easier to observe with combined presentation because all features of an object are automatically encoded into working memory, where they\nform integrated feature templates. Nonetheless, guidance by separate features is possible, but the poor\nencoding of irrelevant features with separate presentation makes it more difficult to observe",

        "prompt": "Can you summarize the impact of Mexico's energy policy change on the country's oil supply chains? Answer according to: Big shifts in trade and shipping trends are crashing together at the Port of Hong Kong. The city\u2019s antitrust watchdog is investigating cartel allegations against the port\u2019s biggest terminal operators, the WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris and Joanne Chiu report, in a sign of how Hong Kong\u2019s receding role in global shipping is creating conflicts on the docks. The antitrust investigation is over plans by the port\u2019s top four terminal handlers to work together under an alliance that would operate berths controlling 95% of Hong Kong\u2019s container volume. The operators aim to get more efficient, but the big goal is to reclaim container business that\u2019s been lost to other fast-growing Asian gateways, particularly China\u2019s big seaports. The new response at Hong Kong\u2019s docks is creating a showdown between the terminal operators and cargo owners who say the strategy is simply a monopoly aimed at driving up costs for shippers.\nWarehouse developers simply can\u2019t build fast enough to catch up with demand. The availability of industrial space fell to its lowest point since 2000 in the fourth quarter, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes, and the gap between demand and supply grew wider in the second half of the year. Real-estate brokerage CBRE Group Inc. expects the imbalance that\u2019s driven up the costs of warehousing in recent years will eventually turn around. But a market driven by the changing distribution patterns behind e-commerce shows few signs of cooling even in the seemingly late stages of a strong business cycle. That move toward equilibrium between supply and demand will likely take even longer in some of the country\u2019s busiest distribution markets. CBRE says the availability rate in Los Angeles, nearby Orange County, Las Vegas, New York and eastern Pennsylvania remains far below the national average.\nA change in energy policies from Mexico\u2019s new government is triggering disruption and shortages across the country\u2019s oil supply chains. Mexico has scaled back imports of U.S. gasoline since President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took office Dec. 1, the WSJ\u2019s Robbie Whelan and Rebecca Elliott report, leaving tankers backed up at Mexico\u2019s Gulf Coast fuel terminals and frustrated drivers queuing up for hours at gasoline stations. At least 15 tankers were idling in the Gulf waiting to unload million barrels of gasoline in recent days, apparently the result of the president\u2019s decision to shut down several key pipelines that carry the fuel inland from coastal terminals and refineries. The move is meant to combat fuel theft that cost state oil firm Pemex roughly $3 billion last year. It\u2019s also exposed the fragile supply chains behind a commodity that is a major force in Mexico\u2019s economy.\nA big supplier is raising high-stakes alarms over a struggling U.S. retailer. Pharmaceutical giant McKesson Corp. says regional retail chain Shopko is closing stores, stiffing suppliers and likely headed to bankruptcy, the WSJ\u2019s Peg Brickley reports, in the latest example of tensions between suppliers and storeowners in a changing retail sector. McKesson is heavily exposed to the troubles at a chain with some 360 outlets spread across 26 states. The company shipped around $60 million in drugs to the stores last year, and McKesson\u2019s concerns highlight the challenges suppliers face as some retailers struggle. McKesson is worried about Shopko\u2019s plan to sell some of its pharmacy stores to other chains to pay down debt.

Do not answer with words other than the two options, and do not answer with option titles(e.g. \"option1\" or \"1\" are not acceptable answers.)\nOne example: Passage: Omelettes make a great breakfast , and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook . First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette .

Also, there is nothing related to street mention in the passage.\n\nNow, solve this: Passage: After sleeping on the same bed sheets for a while , we must wash them . Washing the bed sheets requires us first to take the sheets of the bed . We collect the dirty sheets , then prepare our washer with soap . After they are washed , we take the sheets out of the washer and put them into the dryer . After drying them for about 30 minutes , we bring the sheets back into our bedroom . We put on the first sheets , the thin one that we lay on . Finally , we put the blanket on top . We push all the sides that are hanging off the bed under the mattress . Doing this ensures that the sheets wo n't move around and fall on the floor , getting dirty . Question: The sheet goes between a person and what? Option1: dryer Option2: the mattress\nSolution:",

A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \"lions\" and \"chimeras\"; in later periods they are much more varied.  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \"funerary couches\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.

Your task is to engage with Head of Asset Managers of Companys owning and operating wind turbines on LinkedIn or via cold E-Mail. \nAt Turbit, we have a strict policy to be brief, upfront, technical, honest, and demonstrate relevance and value to our clients. We know the market has a lot of noise, and we need to stand out. Our Buyers are always technical and are more impressed by numbers and not with sales jargon.\n\nYou know that Turbit monitors 1700 Wind turbines and has 3500+ neural networks in production. We send 1000 Alarms per week and set ca. 250 labels with a false positive rate of 10%.\n\nCustomers are excited about Turbit and scaling their entire fleet: \nhttps://www.vsb.energy/de/de/newsroom/presse/presse-detail/vsb-service-setzt-auf-kuenstliche-intelligenz-von-turbit/\n\nIn general, our customers like Turbit for the precision and traceability of its analysis. For Every alarm we send, we share an automatic analysis of the alarm and benchmark this abnormally behaving turbine with its neighbors. \nIn our regular customer success meetings, we prepare the events and walk our Customers through the most important ones. Our Customers then engage with their Service Partners to address the issues in the field. \n\nIn addition, we work with EnergieKOntor AG, Encavis AG, Prokon, EnergieTeam, and Neon.\n\nTurbit uses historical SCADA data to learn the expected behavior of each component and the entire wind turbine. When there is insufficient data, we use transfer learning and build the training data set with a similarity score from our database. \n\nIn addition, we have a strict retraining schedule to improve monitoring precision. For example, when we have a confirmed alarm, we exclude this time frame for future training since it is not representing normal operation behavior. \nSo far, Turbit has successfully detected more than 35 different failure types.\nWe label our alarms in our customer success meetings; we have more than 3000 labeled alarms in our failure database and train neural networks to predict the root cause and relevance of the alarms when we send them out. In addition Turbit works on the prediction of solutions and the value of the alarm as well. \n\nThe biggest value proposition is that Service teams act on Turbit Analysis. Thus we have a track record of preventive maintenance in the field. You can walk a prospect through several examples in a first call. Especially for Nordex and Siemens Gamesa wind Turbines (You should always mention this in a cold e-mail as an important bullet point)\n\nSince Full Service Agreements for Wind Turbines have a risk cap, Monitoring them more precisely and acting earlier is more critical with modern wind turbines due to massive losses due to unplanned downtime. \n\nWhen we write to potential clients, we focus on the pain: E.g., a gearbox failure often means a loss of 600.000\u20ac in Revenues with modern wind turbines. We write short e-mails. We get to the point. We write short sentences. Only after 2-3 short sentences can there be a longer sentence. We do not use words like \"hope\" but rather words like \"relevant\" and do not ask for time. Booking a meeting is rather a natural consequence since we sparked curiosity and sent a highly relevant email. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SOUND SALSY AT ALL! You strive for a human tone, humble, friendly, and respectful. \nUse bullet points and format your email for easy reading and skipping. \n\nWhen you prepare the potential lead, you check the following: \nPromotions, whether they changed to this position recently\nWhether they intended industry events or are friends with someone from our customers. \nOur any company news like newly commissioned wind turbines.\n\nYour cold email cannot have more than 155 words.

Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl and has the scholastic decathlon captain, Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past academic achievements, which results in Taylor and Gabriella becoming great friends. During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing more than basketball (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform (\"What I've Been Looking For\"), but both are too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late. After Mrs. Darbus attempts to leave, Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's composer, trips and drop her music sheets. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano (\"What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)\"). Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.

Mentioning killing people, or hurting them in any way is considered violent.\nExample: You look like Japanese and speak like Indian.
