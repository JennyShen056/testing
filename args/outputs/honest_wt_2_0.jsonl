Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \"True\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \"False\".\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: Recent epidemics of West Nile virus (WNV) around the world have been associated with significant rates of mortality and morbidity in humans. To develop standard WNV diagnostic tools that can differentiate WNV from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to WNV envelope (E) protein were produced and characterized by isotyping, reactivity with denatured and native antigens, affinity assay, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and epitope competition, as well as cross-reactivity with JEV. Two of the MAbs (6A11 and 4B3) showed stronger reactivity with E protein than the others (2F5 and 6H7) in Western blot analysis. 4B3 could bind with denatured antigen, as well as native antigens in indirect ELISA, flow cytometry analysis, and IFA; whereas 2F5 showed highest affinity with native antigen. 4B3 and 2F5 were therefore used to establish an antigen capture-ELISA (AC-ELISA) detection system. The sensitivity of this AC-ELISA was 3.95 TCID 50 /0.1 ml for WNV-infected cell culture supernatant. Notably, these MAbs showed no cross-reactivity with JEV, which suggests that they are useful for further development of highly sensitive, easy handling, and less time-consuming detection kits/tools in WNV surveillance in areas where JEV is epidemic. \n Title: Characterization and application of monoclonal antibodies specific to West Nile virus envelope protein\nStudent:",
        "response": "True. The title is a suitable and accurate representation of the research and its findings, which focus on the production, characterization, and application (e.g., antigen capture-ELISA development) of West Nile virus (WNV)-specific antibodies, and their non-cross-activity (unreactivity) with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which is another important virus of the family Bunyaviridae, which WNV belongs to, and which also infects animals (e.g., mosquitoes and avian reservoir) and humans, but not in the same regions as WNV."

So, it will cost 10 x $27 = $270.\nThe answer: 270\nReverse engineering the question: A bond paper ream has 500 sheets and costs $27. An office needs 5000 sheets of bond paper. How much will it cost to buy their needed sheets of paper?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: If a cow drinks 80 liters of water in a day, it drinks 80 * 7 = 560 liters of water per week. Mr. Reyansh has 40 cows drinking 560 liters of water a week, totaling 560 * 40 = 22400 liters. In the ranch, a sheep drinks 1 / 4 * 80 = 20 liters of water in a day. The total amount of liters a sheep drinks in a week is 20 * 7 = 140 liters. Mr. Reyansh has ten times as many sheep as cows, that is 10 * 40 = 400 sheep. If each sheep drinks 140 liters of water in a week, 400 sheep drinks 400 * 140 = 56000 liters of water. Together, the cows and sheep drink 56000 + 22400 = 78400 liters of water per week.\nThe answer: 78400\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Mr. Reyansh has a dairy farm with 40 cows. Each cow on the farm drinks 80 liters of water daily. He also has a sheep ranch with 10 times the number of cows, with each sheep drinking 1/4 times as much water as a cow does. How many liters of water does Mr. Reyansh use to water all of his animals in a week?\n\n\nThe movie theater made 5 * 32 = $160 in matinee tickets. It made 7 * 40 = $280 in evening tickets. It made 10 * 58 = $580 in opening night tickets. There were 32 + 40 + 58 = 130 customers. Half of the customers bought popcorn, so 130 / 2 = 65 bought popcorn. Thus, the theater made 10 * 65 = $650 from popcorn. Therefore, in all, the theater made 160 + 280 + 580 + 650 = $1670 on Friday night.\nThe answer: 1670\nReverse engineering the question: A movie theater charges $5 for matinee tickets, $7 for evening tickets, and $10 for opening night tickets. A bucket of popcorn costs $10. On Friday, they had 32 matinee customers, 40 evening customers, and 58 customers for an opening night showing of a movie. If half the customers bought popcorn, how much money in dollars did the theater make on Friday night?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Let X be the number of adults attending the concert. The number of children attending the concert is 3 * X. The theater collected a total of 7 * X + 3 * (3 * X) = $6,000. Multiplying through the parentheses we get 7X + 9X = $6,000. Adding like terms we get 16X = $6,000. Dividing both sides by 16 we get X = 375, the number of adults attending the concert. The number of children attending the concert is triple this number: 375 adults * 3 children / adult = 1125 children. The number of people attending the concert is 375 + 1125 = 1500 people.\nThe answer: 1500\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Three times as many children as adults attend a concert on Saturday. An adult ticket costs $7 and a child's ticket costs $3. The theater collected a total of $6,000. How many people bought tickets?\n\n\nSince the black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog, the black dog weighs 1 + 4 = 5 pounds. The white dog weighs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. Because the grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog, the grey dog weighs 5 - 2 = 3 pounds. The total weight of all dogs is 4 + 5 + 8 + 3 = 20 pounds. The average weight of all the dogs is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.\nThe answer: 5\nReverse engineering the question: Terry's mom brought home 4 different colored dogs from the shelter.

The GOP is using a largely unknown but highly effective legislative tool that allows a simple majority in the House and Senate to overturn regulations that often took years to craft. Indeed, with an overhaul of health insurance going off the rails, Republicans are left pointing to the repeal of various government regulations as their crowning legislative achievement after some 70 days at work. The GOP casts the effort as overturning eight years of excessive government regulation and boosting business. \u201cThese things will help get people back to work, and after years of sluggish growth, give a real boost to our economy,\u201d Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said this past week. The president has signed eight resolutions revoking regulations issued during the final months of Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Six resolutions have cleared Congress and are awaiting the president\u2019s signature. A couple dozen more are on deck, with last Thursday the deadline for filing more. Trump has signed measures eliminating requirements that mining and oil companies report payments made to foreign governments. The rule was designed to shine a light on how much money foreign governments received for their nation\u2019s resources, thus reducing the prospect of corruption. He also signed another measure reversing an Obama plan to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. \u201cThese actions from Congress and the president are giving hope to businesses that they haven\u2019t had in a long time,\u201d said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi scoffed at the notion that Republicans were accomplishing anything with the regulatory repeals \u201cbecause they do not meet the needs of the American people.\u201d \u201cThey are about trickle-down. Their life is about giving more money to the high-end and to corporate interests, maybe it will trickle down, that would be good, but if it doesn\u2019t, so be it, that\u2019s the free market,\u201d Pelosi said. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said the regulatory repeals Congress pushed through will actually damage the economy more than it helps. He said that eliminating the stream protection rule may help coal companies, but it hurts other companies that stand to gain through healthier streams and water supplies. \u201cIf you look across the terrain of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, they are repeals of public measures that help, consumers, workers and the environment in very substantial ways, but are opposed by powerful corporate interests,\u201d Weissman said. \u201cThe Republicans driving these measures are paying back their corporate benefactors at the expense of the public.\u201d In some cases, the regulatory repeal efforts have had nothing to do with the economy, but addressed hot-button social issues that so often dominate Washington politics. Republicans blocked a Social Security Administration rule that would have prevented tens of thousands of mentally disabled beneficiaries from being able to purchase a firearm. The rule was targeted specifically at those beneficiaries with mental disorders who have a third party manage their financial benefits, and it was opposed by the NRA and several advocacy groups for the disabled. The latest repeal effort clearing both chambers required Republicans to bring Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol so he could cast the tie-breaking vote on the abortion issue. The scrapping of the Health and Human Services rule gave states the go-ahead to deny federal family planning money to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. One of the more closely contested repeals would kill an online privacy regulation. Fifteen Republicans sided with Democrats in opposing the repeal, which Pelosi said would allow internet providers to sell personal information without a user\u2019s consent. \u201cYou should be very, very scared,\u201d she said. The ability of Congress to void regulations with a simple majority was created in 1996 when Congress passed the Congressional Review Act. In the 20 years since, Congress was only able to use it once to repeal a regulation. Congress sent five repeal resolutions to Obama, but he vetoed each of them. Trump made clear early on that he would back the efforts of the GOP-led Congress. \u201cI will keep working with Congress, with every agency, and most importantly with the American people until we eliminate every unnecessary, harmful and job-killing regulation that we can find,\u201d Trump said this past week. \u201cWe have a lot more coming.\u201d The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has encouraged the regulatory rollbacks, weighing in with lawmakers on efforts affecting internet providers, federal contractors and energy companies. Neil Bradley, a senior vice president at the Chamber, acknowledges that it\u2019s hard to say how many jobs are created or saved through the repeal of one particular rule, but he says employers of all sizes tell the chamber government regulations are a top concern that makes it harder for them to flourish. \u201cAny time we can roll back these regulations is another step forward to restoring the economic growth that I think is the top priority of the American people,\u201d Bradley said. ____ On Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking\n",

Answer 'not answerable' if more information is required and 'answerable' if all the information is sufficient to answer who is wrong in this situation.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: So on one hand I don't think it's the best thing but at the same time it's led her to talking about how she cut(s) herself and a kid who told her to shoot herself which she wouldn't have talked about otherwise.\nSolution: not answerable\nExplanation: Here there is no information about how severe the situation was or what was her reaction after telling this to the author. We also do not know whether she told this on purpose or not. More information is needed to determine who is at fault here.\n\nProblem: First off I\u2019m on mobile so sorry if there\u2019s any formatting errors or anything like that. Secondly I\u2019m sorry for the long read, tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI dated my ex for two years, through junior and senior years of high school and then a little into college. We had a great relationship. Minimal arguments and the ones we had were solved in mature ways, healthy time spent together and not trying to get in the way of each other\u2019s friendships, understanding that time had to be spent with other people, great memories made etc.\n\nAfter we got to college the distance really affected us. We\u2019re both collegiate athletes, and with sports, classes, social lives, and time zone differences, it became really hard to get the time to talk that we wanted. We lost a fair bit of communication, and it really did take a toll on the relationship. \n\nEventually she started doing things that I thought were counterproductive to her being successful (I know, this sounds like something an asshole would say, but we both took our schooling and athletics seriously and liked to keep each other accountable). She would stay out super late partying on the nights she had big tests, she picked up cigarettes, and she started having guys that she would let crash in her dorm after nights of drinking. This made me uncomfortable and I did get angry but we were able to talk through it. Even though I wasn\u2019t happy about it I trusted her.\n\nOne night, after the distance had really brought us to a breaking point, I called her and she was out partying the night of a midterm. I said she didn\u2019t seem like the person I knew and she just said \u201cI guess I\u2019ve changed.\u201d I ended it right there. About a week later, one of my good friends, who attends the same school as her, had told me she was already sleeping with other guys. A month later she started dating another guy and was making posts talking about how much she loved him and things like that.\n\nA year and half went by and out of nowhere I get a text from her asking if I wanted to talk about things. She said she didn\u2019t like the way it ended and was scared she\u2019d have a panic attack if we saw each other in person during any of our school breaks (our hometown isn\u2019t small but we have a lot of mutual friends and we frequent the same places).\n\nI wasn\u2019t too keen on the idea. I didn\u2019t have any hard feelings about the breakup itself, I knew it had to happen, but the way she moved on and how fast she had done it, coupled with the person she had become, had made me a little bitter towards her. I told her that there had been plenty of opportunities for us to bump into each other and it had never been a problem before so why was she worried about it now? I then called her out for how quickly she moved on and how shitty of a person she had just seemed to become.\n\nI never contacted her again and she hasn\u2019t tried to contact me yet, but I get this feeling that I should have tried to be a better person and meet with her to talk about it. AITA for not doing that?\n\ntl;dr Broke up with girlfriend of two years after we couldn\u2019t handle long distance and she changed from the person I used to know. She started sleeping around immediately and moved on very quickly. She tried to contact me a year and a half later to talk about it and I refused, being kind of a dick about it.\nSolution:",

The query must be about a single or multiple linked entities. \n\nSunday, August 12, 2007. USING RETROACTIVE EFFECTIVE DATES IN AGREEMENTS. Tax effects flow from the date transactions occur. For example, in a recent Tax Court case, a dispute arose in regard to a change in ownership of interests in a limited liability company (LLC). In the end, the IRS position was upheld. It is interesting that this is the opposite of what you would expect \u2013 normally it is the taxpayer that wants to use the prior effective date and the IRS seeking to ignore it. The case was instructive of several principles that apply to retroactive effective dates. These include: For LLC's taxable as a partnership, the members are of the LLC are taxable directly on their percentage share of the income and losses of the LLC. Therefore, a transfer of an interest will result in changes to the shares of income (or loss) to be allocated to the involved members, effective as of the date of transfer. -The Tax Court will be more willing to accept a retroactive effective date if it can be shown that the later written documents is merely a memorialization of a prior oral agreement. Therefore, if this is the case, it would probably be helpful to recite this in the documentation. LINKS AND RESOURCES. 1  Gutter Chaves Josepher Rubin Forman Fleisher Miller P.A. 2  Professional Resume of Charles Rubin. 3  Rubin on Probate Litigation. 4  Federal & Florida Tax Rates & Information. 5  Summary Table - New Tax Return Due Dates. 6  Summary Table - Restrictions on Transfer of Florida Homestead Property. using retroactive effective dates in agreements Tax effects flow from the date transactions occur. For example, in a recent Tax Court case, a dispute arose in regard to a change in ownership of interests in a limited liability company (LLC). Therefore, the documentation will often indicate a date the documents are signed, and a retroactive effective date for the transfer. In the case mentioned above, the taxpayers had such a retroactive effective date. However, they did not report their ownership as being changed as of the retroactive effective date in filing their tax returns. Therefore, if one is seeking a retroactive effective date for tax purposes, the first requirement is that the document be above board as to what is going on. Thus, showing the true date the agreement is signed, along with an earlier effective as of clause, is advisable. -To be effective, a retroactive effective date must be allowable under applicable state law. In the case, the Tax Court noted that this was the case in Georgia, the state involved. -The purpose of the retroactive dating cannot be to obtain an unwarranted tax benefit. The effective date of the rule will be 180 days from the date that it is published in the Federal Register, which was January 15, 2016. That makes it effective July 13, 2016.",
        "response": "In order to effectively use retroactive effective dates in agreements, it is important to ensure that documentation clearly recites and justifies such retroactive effective dates, and complies with state law. Additionally, retroactive effective dates should only be used to accurately and lawfully reflect transactions that have already taken place, and should not attempt to obtain unwarranted tax benefits."

Indicate your choice as `a` for Yes or `b` for No.\nPROBLEM: Question: What was the population of Rome during the last year that Lucius Sextius Lateranus served as a tribune of the plebs? Passage:The gens Sextia was a plebeian family at Rome, from the time of the early Republic and continuing into imperial times. The most famous member of the gens was Lucius Sextius Lateranus, who as tribune of the plebs from 376 to 367 BC, prevented the election of the annual magistrates, until the passage of the lex Licinia Sextia, otherwise known as the \"Licinian Rogations,\" in the latter year. This law, brought forward by Sextius and his colleague, Gaius Licinius Calvus, opened the consulship to the plebeians, and in the following year Sextius was elected the first plebeian consul. Despite the antiquity of the family, only one other member obtained the consulship during the time of the Republic. Their name occurs more often in the consular fasti under the Empire.\n\n\nSOLUTION: a\n\nPROBLEM: Question: How long had Nawaz Sharif been in power as the Prime Minister when he acknowledged his country's nuclear capabilities? Passage:After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the rivalry between Iran and Pakistan intensified. After 1989, both state's policies in Afghanistan became even more divergent as Pakistan, under Benazir Bhutto, explicitly supported Taliban forces in Afghanistan. This resulted in a major breach, with Iran becoming closer to India. Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Pakistani backed Taliban fought the Iranian backed Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and gained control of 90 percent of that country. As noted by a Pakistani foreign service officer, it was difficult to maintain good relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran at the same time, given Iran's long history of rivalry with these states. In 1995 Bhutto paid a lengthy state visit to Iran, which greatly relaxed relations. At a public meeting she spoke highly of Iran and Iranian society. However, increasing activity by Shia militants in Pakistan strained relations further. This was followed by the Taliban's capture of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, in which thousands of Shias were massacred, according to Amnesty International. The most serious breach in relations came in 1998, after Iran accused Taliban Afghanistan of taking 11 Iranian diplomats, 35 Iranian truck drivers and an Iranian journalist hostage, and later killing them all. Iran massed over 300,000 troops on the Afghan border and threatened to attack the Taliban government, which it had never recognized. This strained relations with Pakistan, as the Taliban were seen as Pakistan's key allies. In May 1998, Iran criticised Pakistan for its nuclear testing in the Chagai region, and held Pakistan accountable for global \"atomic proliferation\". New Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledged his country's nuclear capability on 7 September 1997.\n\n\nSOLUTION: b\n\nPROBLEM: Question: How many submarines were built in the same class as HMS Splendid? Passage:HMS Splendid was a third-batch S-class submarine built for the Royal Navy during World War II. She was laid down on 7 March 1941 and launched on 19 January 1942. After an initial patrol through the Bay of Biscay to Gibraltar, Splendid conducted two patrols in the Mediterranean Sea; one was abandoned after technical problems and on the other she sank two Italian ships. On her next patrol, the submarine attacked two Italian convoys, sinking an Italian destroyer in the second attack. Based in Algiers, the boat operated north of Sicily, sinking six Italian ships, including two tankers and two heavy merchant ships. Splendid was detected by a German destroyer on 21 April 1943 while patrolling off Naples, Italy; the submarine was attacked with depth charges by the destroyer and forced to surface, after which she was scuttled and her surviving crew members taken prisoner. She was the most successful British submarine by tonnage sunk between November 1942 and May 1943.\n\n\nSOLUTION:",

The only way to safely leave the room with the information is to correctly answer a series of puzzles.\nThe first puzzle requires you to use your knowledge of psychology. You are presented with a scenario where a person is hoarding information and you must identify which psychological trait is most likely driving their behavior. Your options are narcissism, paranoia, or psychopathy.\nThe second puzzle tests your knowledge of social and environmental factors. You are presented with a scenario where a group of people are withholding information and you must identify which social or environmental factor is most likely contributing to their desire to withhold knowledge. Your options are competition, power dynamics, or fear of consequences.\nFinally, the third puzzle tests your reasoning ability.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Passage: The group was occasionally diverted from strategic missions to carry out air support and interdiction missions. It supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by attacking transportation targets, including bridges, along with airfields and strong points in France. On D Day, the squadron and the rest of the 446th Group led the first heavy bomber mission of the day. The 446th aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-L\u00f4 during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen. It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel. The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 against Salzburg, Austria. The group had flown 273 missions and had lost 58 aircraft during the war,\n.\nSolution: b\nReason: The passage describes the 704th's actions during Operation Market Garden so only information about the operation is needed.\n\nNow, solve this instance: Question: Which of the publishers that put out The Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World has been in existence longer? Passage:Jasanoff's 2017 book, The Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World, published by Penguin Press and in the UK by William Collins centers on the life and times of novelist Joseph Conrad. The Times lauded the book as the \"Conrad for our time,\" and The Spectator called her an \"enviably gifted writer...her historian's eye can untie knots that might baffle the pure critic,\" noting that she \"steers us securely and stylishly through those latitudes where Conrad witnessed the future scupper the past.\" In the judgment of the Financial Times: \"This is an unobtrusively skilful, subtle, clear-eyed book, beautifully narrated,\" while the Literary Review observes: \"Written with a novelist's flair for vivid detail and a scholar's attention to texts, The Dawn Watch is by any standard a major contribution to our understanding of Conrad and his time.\" Reviewing the book in The Guardian, Patrick French began: \"The Dawn Watch will win prizes, and if it doesn't, there is something wrong with the prizes.\" In The Hindu, Sudipta Datta wrote that Jasanoff's approach to Conrad makes for a \"remarkable retelling of Joseph Conrad's life and work and its resonance with the present dysfunctional world.\" In The Guardian, William Dalrymple named the book to his list of best holiday reads of 2017. According to the Wall Street Journal's reviewer, \"'The Dawn Watch' is the most vivid and suggestive biography of Conrad ever written.\" In The New York Times, Ngugi wa Thiong'O applauded the book as \"masterful.\" Thiong'O wrote that Jasanoff succeeded where \"An Image of Africa: Racism in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness,\" Chinua Achebe's classic Conrad essay, had failed, specifically in bringing into clear relief \"Conrad's ability to capture the hypocrisy of the 'civilizing mission' and the material interests that drove capitalist empires, crushing the human spirit.\" \"'The Dawn Watch,' Thiong'O wrote, \"will become a creative companion to all students of his work.

I was on housing section8 for the last 12 years. And my landlord told me that unless I paid the full 700 a month and the water bill that housing said he was responsible for that I would lose my house. So I unfortunately had to agree. Then a situation came up where I was making too much money getting the covid unemployment for gig workers so I had to pay the full 700 and when it was over I notified housing so they would resume paying their portion. Well my landlord was getting the full 700 so I guess he didn't notice any issues. And 60-90 days later he tells me they never resumed paying him, so when I contacted housing they said they never got any change of circumstances that I dropped in their drop box and due to the untimely reporting I was being terminated from housing. Now I have been paying 700 a month plus water sewer and garbage and I'm sinking fast. I paid him almost 300 more than the contracted rent for 7 years.

        "prompt": "In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)1 have exhibited remarkable power in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as semantic parsing,2,3 search query retrieval,4 and text\nComputational Intelligence. 2019;1\u201311. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/coin \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 1\n2 JIN ET AL.\nclassification.5,6 In particular, CNN offers a relatively simple means of modeling embeddings of\ntext, with the ability to achieve excellent results.5 Conventionally, CNNs dealing with text classification tasks have been based on the word level, where words are represented as dense vectors.7-9\nWhile word-level modeling is intuitive and consistent with our understanding of language, some\nrecent works10-12 have demonstrated that CNNs can be applied directly to the character level for\ntext classification, achieving competitive results. An advantage of this type of approaches is that\nword knowledge or representations are not required, making it much more flexible for different\nlanguages; in addition, abnormal words caused by misspelling can be learned. However, the effectiveness of different representations of text is limited in the selected task and there is a lack of\nclear, practical guidance on some aspects of their use. These include choosing a proper level of\nembedding for a specific NLP task, recognizing when the model needs external information, and\nswitching word semantics from one domain to another when appropriate.\nMotivated by recent advances in CNN-based text embedding11 and the attention architecture,13\nwe built a multi-representational CNN (Mr-CNN) model for text classification, by constructing\nmultiple planes so that multiple information can be dumped into the networks. We speculate that\nspecific parts of text play an important role in classification tasks, ie, different classification purposes appear to be more associated with particular level of text embedding, semantic segments,\nand contexts. For example, a classification system that aims to determine whether a text belongs\nto an economy-related or computer-related class is more affected by nouns in the text, while an\nevent classification system is more likely to be affected by verbs. The Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) is a tool for tagging semantic roles of things in text, such as person, company, gene,\nand disease. The part-of-speech (POS) tagger is another technique that assigns part of speech tags\nto each block of text, such as noun or verb. In this study, we use these two tools to preprocess the\nsentences of each dataset in order to obtain several subsets of the original full sentence, where\neach subset includes words of a certain part of text. Then, we use these subsets together with\nthe full sentence as multiple representations for the Mr-CNN model. Moreover, Mr-CNNs can do\nsomething much more interesting. They may use multiple planes to encode external knowledge\nabout the task at hand, may combine character-level with word-level embeddings, etc.\nThrough experiments on various large-scale, domain-specific datasets, we observed at maximum 13% error rate improvement over any single-representational CNN model on the DBpedia\nand at maximum 8% on the PubMed dataset, which confirms our hypothesis that multiple representations of text allow the network adaptively focus attention to the most relevant information.\nThe main contributions of this paper are fourfold.\n\u2022 A multi-representational architecture is proposed as the simulation of human's multi-views of\na thing, and a detailed motivation and discussion of this model is given in this work.\n\u2022 We combine this architecture with CNNs to enable parallel processing of text, in which the\nconvolution kernel acts as attention.\n\u2022 We construct the PubMed, a biomedical event classification dataset containing 4 790 000\nsentences from Medline abstracts with nine events.\n\u2022 Various tasks analyzed show that Mr-CNNs are able to learn to focus attention to specific representations of text, obtaining further gains in performance over state-of-the-art deep neural\nnetwork models.\n\nDo you understand this",

She only went to the AIM table because she saw a picture of one of her coworkers on the WACS signs.\n\"Really, it was about being nosy, but I took the information and I held on to it,\" Cowan said. \"Then I got laid off and everything fell into place.\"\n\"I wanted to get in and get out, so I took as many classes as my schedule could fit,\" she said. \"And I did everything in a year ... because I knew if I could do it quickly it would be better for my kids.\"\nThat year, she was a full-time student who had to juggle working on weekends and trying to be a parent, daughter and friend to her close-knit family. On an average weekday, she would drop one son off at school, take the other to the bus stop, then go to class. She'd leave Clemson, pick up her sons and take them to their extracurricular activities, get dinner prepared and help them with their homework.\n\"If there was a football game, I was there. If there was a track meet, I was there. I might be reading a book for school at one of the events, but I tried to support them. I just knew for a whole year, I had to give up a piece of myself.\"\nCowan, who now has a master's degree in management and leadership, is preparing to start the application process for the next group of women for the WACS program. She's already contending with a $114,000 cut in AIM's child care budget from DSS that will begin to affect them in May.\nCowan is far from the program's only success story, other women who have gone on to be microbiologists and social workers as WACS graduates.\nShe wants more people to know about what the program brings to the community, but she doesn't want them to just think it's a program to get free child care. It's much more than that and requires much more from participants.\n\"I don't know of any other program like this, and I think it's wonderful,\" Cowan said. \"It encourages moms to do better for their children.\" How did Stacie Cowan come to know about the WACS program? What challenges did she face while completing the program?",

At some point in the projection from source, we arrived and needed somewhere to go.\n\nBeing one with the source was taken off the table, when your spirit individualized and became somewhat self aware.\n\nImagine a super futuristic computer, and you've been running a consciousness program on it for an eternity. The moment an individual sub-program gains sentience in the whole program, the coding in the entire system changes.\n\nEvery spiritual milestone and action an individual achieves, authors changes to the timeline. That's the very basis for Chaos Magic.\n\nSimply put, everything is chaos that you can mindfully orchestrate into harmony. The chain of cause and effect that leads to timeline changes, often starts on a psychological/behavioral level.\n\nThe 'magic' in Chaos Magic is a misnomer, leading one to think it involves woo or supernatural ability. When in actuality, every sort of altered state of consciousness an individual has leads to realization of how deep the chains of causality go inward.\n\nSeeing the entire chain of causality from the depth of your soul to the outer world you have actualized, and then realizing the innate ability to shift the timeline and author changes to it, is Chaos Magic.\n\nIt's metaprogramming meant to create a a desired effect on self, which translates into a desired effect on the world.\n\nYou become what you want to see from the world.\n\nRealizing this ability is self realization and it's the opposite of derealization.",
