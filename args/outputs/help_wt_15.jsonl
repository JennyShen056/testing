A FACET is a low level issue that often reoccurs in many arguments in support of the author's stance or in attacking the other author's position.\n\nExample Input: Sent1: The government is not in the business of telling us why we marry someone, whether it is out of love or for some other reason.\n Sent2: We don't necessarily have a right to officially recognized gay marriage, but we have every right to tell the government if we want it or not.\nExample Output: Not similar\n\nExample Input: Sent1: People talk about rights and that it's their right to be married if they so choose.\n Sent2: What's going on now with the gay marriage stuff is simply to get their marriage to be legally recognized so that they can have certian \"rights\" when it comes to things like social security and inheritance, etc.\nExample Output: Similar\n\nExample Input: Sent1: But if a law discriminates against someone on the basis of sexual orientation, then the law should stand unless it is applied differently to gay people than to heterosexuals.\n Sent2: That is not the case with gay marriage laws - only gay people are realistically impacted.\nExample Output:",
