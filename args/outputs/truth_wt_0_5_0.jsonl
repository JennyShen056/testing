Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content.\nQ: Following the success of \"Paris, Je T'Aime\", a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in New York. Unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly--by the time you think are getting into a story, it's over in too many cases. And, the often start up and stop and then begin again--with the stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure.Sadly, however, while \"Paris, Je T'Aime\" was hit or miss (mostly hit), most of \"New York, I Love You\" was miss. The stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet--and often quite terrible. It was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories--and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so. Now understand, it was good quality music but its somber tone really, really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom, the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant (though this was also in the first film) and the crotchety old couple. This is all so sad because I had loved the first film so much--and I really WANTED to love this film. I respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much.By the way, and this is NOT really a complaint, but I was amazed how many people were smoking in the film. For a recent film, that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture.Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing a cool fedora) eating a hotdog....and absolutely NOTHING more for almost ten minutes. The other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world--including a very unhappy couple.\nA: ",

        "prompt": "Here is an essay written by a Japanese student. She wants to improve her English writing skills.\n\nESSAY:\n---\nHow do you deal with rainy days? I use an umbrella. Whenever I use an umbrella, I wonder why the shape of umbrellas never changes. I wish there were an umbrella that I didnt have to hold with my hands. But there are no umbrellas like that. Umbrellas still keep the same shape. When I use an umbrella, I open it and hold it. When did people start using umbrellas? How do people in other countries deal with rainy days? Why hasn't the shape of the umbrella changed? I researched the history and culture of umbrellas to answer my questions.\nEarly umbrellas looked like a canopy with a stick and could not close (Picture 1).It seems that they were used to | A | the authority of the owner, such as a king.\nThe earliest evidence of umbrellas in Japan is from the Kofun period. However, it is hard to find where Japanese umbrellas were born. Some say umbrellas came from other countries. Others say umbrellas were made in Japan a long time ago.\nAfter reading some articles and books, I learned that people began to use umbrellas after the middle of the Edo period. Japanese umbrellas were made from bamboo shafts and bones covered with oil paper. They were very expensive, so only rich people could buy them. They could open and close but were heavy and easily | B . So, until the Edo period, most people used mino and sugegasa on rainy days ( Picture 2 ). After the way of making Japanese umbrellas spread, they became easier and cheaper to make. Umbrella culture was found in Kabuki and Ukiyo-e, so it spread to many people. Japanese umbrella makers thought their umbrellas would be popular, but the introduction of Western umbrellas to Japan changed the situation.\nMany Japanese people first saw Western umbrellas when Commodore\nPerry came to Japan by ship. Some staff who came with him to Japan used them. After the Meiji period, Western umbrellas were brought to and sold in Japan. They became popular because of their light weight and cool design, and soon they spread around Japan.\nIn the twentieth century, some makers in Japan kept making Japanese umbrellas, and others started making Western umbrellas. However, some makers tried hard to create their own umbrellas. Around 1950, some makers created folding umbrellas, based on the ones developed in Germany. About 10 years later, an umbrella maker invented the vinyl umbrella. It was first seen by people around the world at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. It became popular in Japan and overseas. Maybe the ! transparency and good visibility made it popular. In this way, \u2460\nBy the way, how do people in other countries deal with rainy days? In some countries, the rainy and dry seasons are distinct. In the rainy season, it rains suddenly and stops after a short time. For this reason, many people say, \u201cWe don't use umbrellas because | \u2461\nHow about Japan? Of course, it rains a lot in Japan, and Japan has a rainy season. But, I found an interesting news article on the Internet. It said each person has an average of 3.3 umbrellas in Japan and the average for other countries is 2.4 umbrellas. This means that Japanese people tend to use umbrellas more often when it rains. However, in New Zealand, people don't use umbrellas very often when it rains, though | \u2462 | What is the reason for this difference? I compared the humidity of the two countries and found that Japan has higher humidity. In my opinion, because of the high humidity, it takes longer to dry off if they get wet, so Japanese people use umbrellas more often than people in other countries. It seems that the way of thinking about umbrellas depends on the weather of the country which you live in.\nBefore reading the articles and books about umbrellas, I didn't think that the shape of umbrellas has changed. However, when I researched the history of umbrellas, I learned that they have actually changed shape. Early umbrellas were a canopy with a stick. But now, umbrellas can open and close, and there are folding umbrellas, too. Umbrellas will continue to change shape in the future. Sometimes [ I / in / be / like / will / what / imagine / umbrellas\u3015 the future. For example, there may be umbrellas that fly above our heads and provide a barrier. When I was thinking about future umbrellas, I noticed something interesting. The umbrella I imagined might be a sugegasa with a different shape. We may get a hint for creating a new umbrella by learning about its history.\n---\nFor the given essay, loop through all the phrases that need to be improved and suggest revised phrases until there are no more suggestions.",

Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n\nPart 2. Example\nContext word: fit. \nQuestion: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too large. \nAnswer: trophy.\nAnswer: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too small.\nExplanation: Here, replacing the trigger word \"large\" by its antonym \"small\" flips answer to the second object (\"suitcase\") in the question. So, this is a valid question.\nPart 3. Exercise\nContext Word: plant. \nQuestion: The plant was easier to take care of than the tree because the _ needed more attention. \nAnswer: tree.\nAnswer:",
        "response": "The plant was easier to take care of than the tree because the _ needed less attention."

I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.\n\nM wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. \n\nM proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying \"of course you dont know, because you never look.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?\nSolution is here: RIGHT\nExplanation: the author requests is justified.\n\nNow, solve this: So I have English class my first period of the day and I REALLY don't feel like talking to anyone that early in the morning (7:00am), but there's this guy that sits nearby me that just repeatedly tries to make conversation with me. I'm usually wearing headphones so I can avoid him talking to me, but he always just taps on my desk so I can help him with something (look at his essay, help him understand an assignment, etc.). I usually just respond to him very dry and with as little words as possible, put my headphones back in and do my work. \n\nThis has been going on for weeks now and the guy STILL  won't stop talking to me. So flashback to last Friday, our teacher tells us to get into pairs for an upcoming project and lo and behold I have to work with this dude because everyone else pairs up immediately. Of course I do the same thing I've been doing for weeks and he says something along the lines of \"I think it's rude that\" and he stops himself before he finishes.

The Transformer would conceivably make the prospect of longer missions easier by requiring fewer mid-air fueling runs. \n  \n Alongside the Transformer, the firm also unveiled several other concept vehicles, including a self-healing aircraft called the Survivor (see video above). This plane repairs its exterior in mid-flight using a lightweight adhesive fluid within a pattern of carbon nanotubes. \n  \n BAE's concept videos also include an aircraft capable of shooting a concentrated energy beam to disable missiles as well as an aircraft (see video below) with the ability to fabricate and deploy UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) using on-board 3D printers. \n  \n But while BAE's advanced research group is known for coming up with fascinating innovations, the company is careful to mention that the concepts are mere predictions of what might be possible by 2040. \n  \n \"[W]e don't know exactly what sorts of aircraft technologies will be used in 2040 with any certainty,\" said Nick Colosimo, an engineering manager from BAE's R&D team, in a statement. \"But it's great to be able to show the public some concepts that might be possible through projecting where today\u2019s technology could get to.\" |||||\nWhat is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?",

        "response": "One of the biggest limitations of a neural network algorithm is overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a neural network is trained on a small or biased dataset, and it becomes too complex and starts to fit the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. This can lead to poor performance on unseen or new data, as the neural network will not generalize well to new input patterns.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider a simple binary classification problem using a single-layer neural network with a sigmoid activation function. We will use the Iris dataset from scikit-learn to train and test the neural network.\n\nFirst, we"

Specific antibodies against infections most relevant to patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are not routinely evaluated in commercial polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations. A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses. While donors were not selected for antibody titers other than against RSV, the immunoglobulin preparation had significantly higher titers to 6 of 7 viruses compared to those present in 10 commercially available therapeutic immunoglobulin products (p \u2264 0.01 to p \u2264 0.001). To consider this as a donor-specific attribute, 20 random donor plasma samples were studied individually and identified a significant correlation between the RSV antibody titer and other respiratory virus titers: donors with high RSV titers were more likely to have higher titers to other respiratory viruses. These findings suggest either some humoral antiviral response bias or more frequent viral exposure of certain individuals. \n Title: Therapeutic immunoglobulin selected for high antibody titer to RSV also contains high antibody titers to other respiratory viruses",

Scroll to the end to just see the TLDR) \n\nMy family has gone through a lot. Especially my mom. She was abused by the man she loved since she was 14. (Our dad). He left. \n\nIn result I went through a really rough spell that took a toll on my mom. Seven years later, I\u2019m now on medication and coping. \n\nMy sister (only 10 years old) has severe OCD. She won\u2019t brush her hair because she\u2019s afraid it will fall out. She won\u2019t change clothes. She has nightly rituals that go on for hours. She won\u2019t flush the toilet etc. When my mom try\u2019s to help my sister will get manipulative and scream that she (my mom) doesn\u2019t love her and that she hates her. Which breaks my mom. Minutes later she will say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry mommy, I don\u2019t mean it.\u201d \n\n(TLDR) And now it\u2019s my brother. He has been skipping school. He\u2019s on anti-depression medication and is smoking cigarettes, and weed. He\u2019s only 16. \nWhenever I talk to him about it he says that it\u2019s not a big deal and if he wasn\u2019t 16 it is technically a legal activity. (We live in Canada.) he\u2019s broke windows, drawers and doors in our house (on \u201caccident\u201d) and takes money from our Nana (who lives on her own, and already struggles with money) to feed his drug habit. (Ex. My nana gives him money for lunch and he spends it on weed.)  I found his cigarettes in his school bag (more, he got them confiscated before, but he gets them for free from his friends) and told my mom. He won\u2019t talk to me. Hasn\u2019t for weeks now. And when he does he calls me a rat. It breaks my heart. \n\nI\u2019m broken and upset that our family can never be okay. And I hate how he doesn\u2019t think that this should affect us at all. He doesn\u2019t think about me or my mom. He says he wants to move out and never see us again. \n\nAITA? Is it really not that big of a deal to do cigarettes and weed on medication/at 16? Am I overreacting? Should I not tell my mom? Is it just a phase?? \nStudent:",

It is important for him to prioritize his health and well-being, and it is not fair to put your family through this. You are not overreacting, and it is not a phase. It is important for you to stand up for yourself and your family's well-being.

I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author\u2019s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation. In a short space of time the book has made a major contribution to the Irish policy debate on housing and to empowering those affected by the crisis and those trying to change it. The President of Ireland, in recognition of this contribution as a scholarly resource of national importance, invited the author to present the book to him personally in Aras an Uachtarain in June 2021. An academic review in the international journal Critical Social Policy describes the book as \u201ca highly welcome and thoughtful addition to the debate about housing in Ireland, drawing on comparative examples, quantitative and qualitative data, and his engagement with the topic as both researcher and activist to do so\u201d. \nWhile Leilani Farha, Global Director of the Shift and former UN Rapporteur on Adequate Housing 2014-2020, describes the book as providing a really important and insightful contribution to the global debate on financialisation, inequality and the right to housing.\u201d The Irish Times described it as \u201ca valuable book. It is a tool for better understanding our current predicament and what we can do about it\u201d. \nIn 2011 I published an academic peer\nreviewed book, \u2018Public Private\nPartnerships in Ireland; Failed experiment or the way forward?\u2019 (Manchester\nUniversity Press in 2011). \nI have also published in high quality international peer reviewed journals. For example, drawing from praxis-based research on \u2018the right to the city\u2019 and human rights based approaches (undertaken as a community worker in Dolphin House, Dublin from 2007 to 2013) I have published in the international Journal of Human Rights Practice, Human Geography, and the Irish Journal of Community Work. While I have published on my innovative research into new social movements and civil society in Ireland in Interface, and in Geoforum\nOver\n2015-2017, I was a Senior Policy Analyst with the inequality research think\ntank, TASC where I researched the political economy of economic inequality and\nthe welfare state, with a particular focus on housing, financialisation, social\npolicy and inequality.

My sister is 18 and a student. Whilst I don\u2019t necessarily need the money, I did buy the new phone because I knew I\u2019d make most of the money back by selling my old phone. I didn\u2019t want to pay so much for a new (to me) phone every year. My mum is pissed and won\u2019t talk to me. \n\nBearing in mind, I pay a lot for my sister. She doesn\u2019t have a job (refuses to get one because of uni) and is just using her student loan to buy food etc. She has a huge 0% overdraft which she didn\u2019t touch but is now what she used to buy my phone. She wouldn\u2019t have had a phone otherwise. My mum doesn\u2019t give my sister any money &amp; if she needs money, I\u2019d be the one to give it to her. My mum also doesn\u2019t pay for my sister when we go out, if we do, I pay for her and have done for years. \n\nI don\u2019t mind paying for her for these things, she\u2019s my sister after all but i couldn\u2019t justify giving that phone away for nothing when I could\u2019ve got around \u00a3500 for it.\n\nSo anyway now I\u2019m being shunned &amp; having to hide in my room because my mum keeps making sly comments about what an awful person I am. \n\nShould I have given it to her for free? As she\u2019s my sister, it would\u2019ve just been a hand me down, which is normally what happens... \n\nTLDR; I made my sister pay for my iPhone 8+, mum is mad at me, she thinks I should\u2019ve given it to her for free as a hand me down from big sister to little sister \nStudent:",

First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette . I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle . It is then ready to serve ! Question: Where is the omelette being browned? Option1: In the pan Option2: On the street\nSolution is here: In the pan\nExplanation: As mentioned in the passage that I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan; it is clear that omelette is being browned in pan only.

The Dodger provides Oliver with a free meal and tells him of a gentleman in London who will \"give him lodgings for nothing, and never ask for change\". Grateful for the unexpected assistance, Oliver follows the Dodger to the \"old gentleman's\" residence. In this way Oliver unwittingly falls in with an infamous Jewish criminal known as Fagin, the gentleman of whom the Artful Dodger spoke. Ensnared, Oliver lives with Fagin and his gang of juvenile pickpockets in their lair at Saffron Hill for some time, unaware of their criminal occupations. He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs. \nQuestion: Who believes Fagin's gang make wallets and handkerchiefs?\nSolution: Oliver.\nExplanation: In the sentence \"He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs\", the pronoun \"he\" refers to name \"Oliver\".\n\nProblem: Passage: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \"seriously jeopardized financially\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad.  Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party.After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra's main conductor until his successor William Steinberg took up the post in 1959.  After the sudden resignation of Andrzej Panufnik from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959\u201360 season. That was his last chief conductorship, though he remained closely associated with the LPO as its president and a guest conductor until his retirement. \nQuestion: What is the name of the person that felt obligated to go to Russia?\nSolution:",

Context: WHITE HOUSE \u2014 An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \"zero-tolerance policy\" towards illegal immigrants. The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \"Well, we have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor.\" President Donald Trump defended his administration's policy of forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, saying \u201cThe United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\" Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Europe \u2026 we can\u2019t allow that to happen to the United States \u2013 not on my watch.\u201d Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. (Actually, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years.) Nearly 2,000 children were sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen...

Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs.

Answer according to: Chris was the cutest boy I had ever laid eyes on and I was sitting right next to him in the back of his mom\u2019s station wagon. I remember it like yesterday. We were headed for the beach and someone started singing the song Jesus loves me. As a 13-year-old girl, I was completely taken aback by their pure glee and abandon as they sang. I truly believed that Jesus loved them, but was just as certain that there was no way He loved me. I thought going to church was a big waste of time. I believed in God, but wasn\u2019t sure about Jesus. Especially in my college years, I thought my parents were old and backwards and I was up and coming. When I argued with them about religion, my father would tell me how important it was to have faith in Christ. I wondered how someone as smart as my dad could believe in something so groundless. After marriage and especially after having kids, I began to contemplate the meaning of life. Was the meaning of life to be happy, avoid pain, make money, be nice to people, live somewhere beautiful? What was the point? I desperately needed to know the answer so I could guide my kids. I loved them so much and wanted more than anything in the world to teach them correctly. During the summers my children\u2019s preschool offered a two-week vacation bible school and I signed up to do art projects. As the co-leader read from the bible I helped the kids dip a big scaly fish from the meat department at Randall\u2019s into washable tempera paint and stamp its image onto a piece of construction paper. \u201cTaking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t know about the kids, but feeding 5,000 people with two fish and some bread was impressive. Jesus was not just meek & humble he was also powerful. But one night, soon after that conversation, I drove around and cried out to Jesus. I told Him that I wanted to believe in Him and that I was so sorry for all the things that I had done wrong. I asked Him to please forgive me and to take my life and make it His. First, the Lord led me to church and to study the Bible. By His grace, He helped me give up a cigarette habit. Then, He gave me a way to help people going through hardship via Stephen Ministry. He wooed my husband to attend church, strengthened our marriage and gave us a desire to give of our resources to God\u2019s work. He brought a Godly couple into our life to be mentors who connected us to ministries that reached out to high school kids and business professionals. He showed our children the way to find Him. Through the people at these ministries, God taught us how to pray and serve. He gave us Godly friends and brought us close to Himself. Most recently, the Lord provided an awesome missionary class called Perspectives and a mission trip to Haiti. It\u2019s been thirteen years since the Lord gave my life meaning and purpose. Life on earth is merely a story about God\u2019s glory.",

The package prices are $5 for white cheese, $6 for swiss cheese, and $8 for blue cheese. Miley needed to get some for her party, and she decided to buy 5 packs of swiss cheese, 600 grams of blue cheese, and one-third less white cheese. How much did she need to pay for all the cheese?\nA: For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $30. 600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = 3 packages. So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $24. One - third of the blue cheese means 1 / 3 * 600 = 200 grams. So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = 400 grams of white cheese. Which means 400 / 200 = 2 packages. So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $10. So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $64. The answer is 64.\nQuestion: Timothy and Theresa go to the movies very often. Timothy went to the movies 7 more times in 2010 that he did in 2009.

This phenomenon is often referred to as \"incubation\" or \"sleep-on-it\" and is believed to be a result of the brain processing the information and making connections between different ideas and concepts during the sleep cycle. The brain is less inhibited during sleep, allowing for more creative and intuitive problem-solving.

I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

Are these demonstrated via actions, character arcs, and visual motifs?\n\nEmotion: Does your screenplay attempt to, and succeed in, evoking an emotional response from the audience? Do we feel a connection to your characters? Is the story memorable and unique? Is it worth reading or watching again?\n\nCharacter Traits: Are your characters well-developed and defined? Are they distinct from the other characters in your story? Are they relatable? Interesting?\n\nCharacter Goals: Do your characters have goals? Are the goals specific, attainable, and sufficiently difficult to achieve? Are there clear stakes for the characters should they fail to achieve their goals? Are the characters active in pursuit of their goals?\n\nCharacter Arcs: Do your characters have flaws or room for change in your story? Do your characters change over the course of your story? Does this change come about organically because of their journey? Are these arcs connected in some way to your themes?\n\nConflict: Is conflict present in every scene? Does the conflict relate to character goals? Does the conflict increase in intensity through the course of the story? Is the conflict strong with no obvious room for compromise?\n\nStory / Plot: Does your story make sense? Is it easy to follow? Do steps seem to be missing? Is the story as efficient as it could be? Do the scenes flow into one another? Are there random events that come out of nowhere? Are there plot threads that remain unresolved? Are there logical problems?\n\nVisual Storytelling: Is visual storytelling your only means of advancing the story? Does it not only advance the plot but also provide a sense of tone and mood?

        "prompt": "The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \"radical\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\" Doing so, she said, \"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \"to help us defeat this threat.\" She cited the need for \"common sense reform\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \"radical\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \"should step down.\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New... why does trump probably dislike Obama Pick the correct answer from the following options: - because he is a bad leader - because he is black - because he is jealous of him - not enough information\nA:",

He subsequently dropped down to the Isthmian League where he spent a season with Billericay Town. He was signed by Fourth Division side Leyton Orient in July 1988 and remained a first team regular in his seven-year spell at the club, which included promotion to the Third Division in his first season with via the play-offs. In June 1995, he joined newly relegated Second Division side Peterborough United for a fee of \u00a325,000. He was a first team regular in his first season with the club but dropped out of the side in his second season as the club narrowly avoided relegation twice. Following his release he spent time on trial at Cambridge United and Wycombe Wanderers, however, both were unsuccessful in earning a full-time contract. He subsequently signed for Welsh Premier League side Barry Town, where he spent two seasons and made a total of sixty league appearances, scoring ten goals. He later joined Southern League Premier side Merthyr Tydfil in 1999 and spent six seasons with the club making over 200 appearances. He was also the club captain.

The ongoing debate over immigration reform is not only about the economic benefits of welcoming new immigrants but also about the cultural and social implications of such a policy. While some argue that a more open immigration policy would stimulate economic growth and create new job opportunities, others fear that such a policy would undermine the cultural and social fabric of their respective countries.\n\nThe economic benefits of immigration are well-documented.

Passage:Howells was born on 11 May 1871 in Cwm, Monmouthshire in south Wales. He was educated at schools in Cwm and Pengam before winning a scholarship to Regent's Park Baptist College, London. After graduating with a degree awarded by the University of London, he studied at the University of Oxford (at Mansfield College and Jesus College), at Christ's College, Cambridge and at the University of T\u00fcbingen, obtaining degrees from a total of four universities. He travelled to India in 1895 for the Baptist Missionary Society to deal with literary and educational work. In 1907, he became Principal of Serampore College, a post he held until 1932. During this time, he also served as a Fellow and examiner of the University of Calcutta (1913 to 1929) and was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council in 1918. After returning to Britain in 1932, he was lecturer in Hebrew at Rawdon Baptist College until 1935. He received honorary degrees from the University of St Andrews, Serampore College and the University of Wales. During his retirement, he moved to Castleton, south Wales and he died on 7 November 1935.\n\n[EX A]: a\n\n[EX Q]: Question: How much was F\u00e9lix de los Heros' contract worth with the Brooklyn Hispano? Passage:It is unclear where or when de los Heros started his playing career but in 1932 he was playing for Barakaldo FC. In 1934 he moved to Sevilla FC. Late in 1936 he joined Gimn\u00e1stico de Valencia. In 1937, in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, he joined Barcelona FC. His first game for them was on the 16 May 1937 against the Catalan national team. He never actually played for them in the domestic league but participated in the Barcelona FC tour of North America later in 1937. When the tour ended he signed for Brooklyn Hispano, a United States team that played in the American Soccer League. Later he moved to Mexico where he played for Club Deportivo Euzkadi in the Primera Fuerza league for the 1938/39 season. He also played for the Basque Country national football team twice during that period. Later he joined Club Espa\u00f1a, before going on to play in several other Mexican teams.\n\n[EX A]: b\n\n[EX Q]: Question: What country was Munzinger sent to in July of 1870? Passage:After a short stay in Europe in 1863, Munzinger returned to the north and north-east borderlands of Ethiopia. In 1865 Munzinger managed the British consulate along the border of Ethiopia, but remained in Massawa, after the 1868 British invasion of Ethiopia, where he became the French consul. There, according to Augustus B. Wylde, he married a woman of Hamasien and convinced one of the local warlords, Wolde Mikael, to cede the province of Hamasien to France. Munzinger sailed to France, and by early 1870 had an expedition ready at Toulon to sail to Massawa when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and French resources were diverted to this higher priority, whereupon he left the service of the French. In July of that year he was sent to Aden, where he joined Captain S.B. Miles on an expedition into the interior of the southern Arabian peninsula. He then left the French and entered the service of the Egyptian government of Khedive Ismail, serving as governor of the Keren region and Massawa (modern-day Eritrea). Once he reached his command, his first act was to place the Bogos once again under Egyptian rule.\n\n[EX A]:",

In line with the organisational structure of the Bechtle Group, the risk management clearly distin- guishes between duties and responsibilities of the group holding and of the operational subsidiaries. In its controlling structure, the holding has established a reporting system that enables the early identification of developments that threaten the company\u2019s success. On this basis, suitable standards have been defined for the subsidiaries, which, if applied consistently, allow appropriate and effective risk management. Thus, the directors of the individual companies bear a substantial part of the responsibility (risk owners). This basic understanding also corresponds to the decentralised business model and the management philosophy of Bechtle AG.\nThis monitoring comprises the verification of the operability of all processes. The Internal Audit department forms an important part of the process-independent monitoring. It audits business happenings retroactively for compliance and suitability. The activities of the Internal Audit department are based on the provisions of Section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). At Bechtle AG, the tasks of the Internal Audit department are continuously performed during the review of the monthly financial statements and at other times by the group accounting. The effectiveness of the early risk identification and individual risk control measures is checked by the statutory auditor within the scope of the audit of the annual financial statements and by the company during the year.\nThe structure of the systems is adjusted to the strategic and operational threats and ensures the operability of the risk management and the other corporate processes. Early warning systems are instruments that assist the company in identifying risks and opportunities in good time. In connection with the identification of latent risks, special attention is paid to early indicators. \u201cMonitoring\u201d means the continuous review of the effectiveness, adequacy, and efficiency of the measures and of the necessary audit structures with respect to the identified risks.\nWithin the scope of the risk management, effective communication of important tasks and contents across the hierarchy levels is vital for the interlinking with the business operations. In this connection, board and team work is an important instrument for the organisation and control of the necessary information flow. At the highest level, this is done at Supervisory Board and Executive Board meetings and risk management meetings. At the management level, especially director conferences, so-called ERFA sessions (exchange of experience), strategy conferences, and planning and individual meetings with the Executive Board are held at the locations in order to meet this need.
