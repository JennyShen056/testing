The study has demonstrated that the treatment of cells with the factor leads to the upregulation of the mRNA expression and protein concentration of the chemokine in the supernatant of the cells. This effect is partially inhibited by the treatment of the supernatant of the cells with anti-fractalkine antibodies. The signaling molecule, MAPK, is activated"

The present study investigated the clinical role of Wee1 in advanced-stage (FIGO III-IV) ovarian serous carcinoma.', 'Wee1 protein expression was analyzed in 287 effusions using immunohistochemistry. Expression was analyzed for association with clinicopathologic parameters, including survival. Forty-five effusions were additionally studied using Western blotting. Wee1 was further silenced in SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells by siRNA knockdown and proliferation was assessed.', 'Nuclear expression of Wee1 in tumor cells was observed in 265/287 (92%) and 45/45 (100%) effusions by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. Wee1 expression by immunohistochemistry was significantly higher in post-chemotherapy disease recurrence compared to pre-chemotherapy effusions obtained at diagnosis (p=0.002). Wee1 silencing in SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells reduced proliferation. In univariate survival analysis of the entire cohort, a trend was observed between high (>25% of cells) Wee1 expression and poor overall survival (p=0.083). Survival analysis for 109 patients with post-chemotherapy effusions showed significant association between Wee1 expression and poor overall survival (p=0.004), a finding which retained its independent prognostic role in Cox multivariate analysis (p=0.003).\n[EX A]: 1\n\n[EX Q]: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain protein (NFL) is a sensitive marker of neuronal injury in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including the CNS dysfunction injury that is common in untreated HIV infection. However, an important limitation is the requirement for lumbar puncture. For this reason, a sensitive and reliable blood biomarker of CNS injury would represent a welcome advance in both clinical and research settings.', 'To explore whether plasma concentrations of NFL might be used to detect CNS injury in HIV infection, an ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay was developed. Using a cross-sectional design, we measured NFL in paired CSF and plasma samples from 121 HIV-infected subjects divided into groups according to stage of their systemic disease, presence of overt HIV-associated dementia (HAD), and after antiretroviral treatment (ART)-induced viral suppression. HIV-negative controls were also examined.', 'Plasma and CSF NFL concentrations were very highly correlated (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). While NFL was more than 50-fold lower plasma than CSF it was within the quantifiable range of the new plasma assay in all subjects, including the HIV negatives and the HIV positives with normal CSF NFL concentrations. The pattern of NFL changes were almost identical in plasma and CSF, both exhibiting similar age-related increases in concentrations along with highest values in HAD and substantial elevations in ART-na\u00efve neuroasymptomatic subjects with low blood CD4(+) T cells.\n[EX A]: 0\n\n[EX Q]: Although right-sided diverticulitis is perceived to have a higher incidence among Asians and infrequently requires surgical management in comparison with sigmoid diverticulitis, it is unknown whether differences in outcomes are due to ethnic disparity or disease pathophysiology.', 'The aim of this study was to determine the surgical outcomes for Asian and non-Asian patients with diverticulitis who underwent colectomy.', 'Patients identifiable by ethnicity in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample with diverticulitis and colectomy between 2004 and 2010 were included. Univariate comparisons were made between Asian and non-Asian patients by using t tests for continuous variables and \u03c7 tests for categorical variables.

        "prompt": "Please answer the following question: My love affair with technology began at an early age. On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it.

Your task is to \"decompose the question\"i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question.

I really appreciate you stopping by and sharing. I am so glad God uses my blog to inspire and bring you memories of your growing up years in Romania. Was thrilled to hear that you made it to Montana! Montana is indeed a beautiful state... just these past several weeks I've been in awe with the changing colors... such a beautiful sight to behold... the red, orange, yellow and green leaves signaling that Fall has officially arrived. I never tire of the different seasonal changes here. May God continue to use your cooking talent to serve others. And as you said, HE gave us the cooking to be used for HIS glory. May you enjoy the rest of your vacation here in Montana... God bless your hands in the kitchen as you lovingly take care of your family. And you are always welcome here to read, try a recipe or two or just to reminisce about your beautiful time in Romania. I always love to hear from my readers:). Much love to you! I am in awe of the photos of Montana. I think you live in Paradise. I came to your site when I discovered the Japanese Milk Bread Recipe. I search for recipes on the Internet almost daily because I love to Cook/Bake and try new Recipes. I wanted to try it out your recipe because I have a Friend who has a Daughter-in-Law who is Japanese. My friend - is a Real Estate agent searching for a house for us. So when I saw the recipe for Japanese Milk Bread I sent him the Recipe because he loves everything Japanese after visiting there a few years ago. I am English born Canadian but lived in an Acadian Village for several years - Isn't t great how all our cultures and languages are coming together from your Recipe Site? I will be trying the Japanese Milk Bread soon. Your Love and Devotion to the Lord shines out in your words and recipes. How different from many other sites. And it is a reminder to me of how I have neglected the Lord in my life lately and how I need to focus on him with ALL MY HEART AND SOUL. Was it God who led me to your site to lead me back to him - I would say yes. It touched me so much. It was his unmistakable hand - a gentle reminder of what I can yet do for him in my life if I once again give it over to him. God bless you... and thanks so much for stopping by and taking the time to write such an encouraging comment! It was such a delight to hear from you. I was simply touched with your comment, and I know the Lord used you to strengthen my faith in Him. He is ever so kind to let us know how He sometimes uses us in ways unbeknownst to us. I am grateful to know that the blog has been of help to you, not only in searching for recipes, but as a reminder to draw nearer to the Lord God(which is of eternal importance). I sure hope you enjoy making the a Japanese bread... it is wonderfully light and airy. My husband and I have had the privilege of visiting Japan twice now and it is one place I would love to visit again. Hopefully your friend's daughter in law will enjoy a slice or two of the bread:)... how fun to hear that you love to cook and bake! Stephanie, I pray the Lord will direct your heart and soul to grow in the knowledge of Hin through His Word... that you may be a Light unto Him there where He has placed you. May He richly bless you... and thanks again for stopping by!",

Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song \"La Marseillaise\" (as Marching song for the Army of the Rhine), which later became the anthem of France. \"La Marseillaise\" was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg Philippe-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Dietrich. Some of the most famous generals of the French Revolution also came from Alsace, notably Kellermann, the victor of Valmy, Kl\u00e9ber, who led the armies of the French Republic in Vend\u00e9e and Westermann, who also fought in the Vend\u00e9e.\".

        "prompt": "summarize the following article.\nIt seems Oreos are as habit-forming as cocaine \u2014 for rats, anyhow.\n\nAt least that's what a new study has found. The study was run by science professor Joseph Schroeder and his students. It used rats to test foods with a lot of fat and sugar in them, to see if the foods might be making people addicted. In other words, would it be really hard for people to stop eating those foods?\n\nThe results? Rats seemed to like cookies as much as cocaine.\n\nThe study shows that foods with a lot of fat and sugar do the same thing to the brain that drugs do, Schroeder said. That may explain why some people can't stop eating them, even when \"they know they are bad for them.\"\n\nRats Race To Oreos\nThe study was thought up by college student Jamie Honohan.\n\nHonohan wondered why so many poor people are obese \u2014 that is, very overweight. She wanted to test the idea that high-fat, high-sugar foods are as addictive as drugs.\n\nThere was a reason Oreos were chosen, Schroeder said. The researchers wanted something that was tasty for humans as well as rats. That way the study would say something about \"a problem facing humans.\"\n\nHonohan said she also wanted to use something common in grocery stores. Plus, she noted, rats really like Oreos.\n\nThe researchers set up two little rooms for the rats. Then, they tried several different experiments.\n\nIn one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one space and rice cakes in the other. It was clear that the rats preferred the Oreos, she said. They split the cookies apart and gobbled up the cream. Then, they went on to eat all the cookies. Not all the rice cakes got eaten.\n\nAfter this, the food was removed. The rats were given the choice of where to spend time. They spent far more time in the room where the Oreos had been, than where the rice cakes had been.\n\nRats Get A Sugar High\nThe researchers did the same experiment with drugs. Rats were given a shot of cocaine in one room. And in the other room, they were injected with salt water. Then the shots were stopped. The rats were given the choice of which room to spend time in. They liked the room where the drugs had been better.\n\nWhat did the researchers observe? The rats spent as many hours in the Oreos room as they did in the drug room.\n\nThen the researchers looked at what was going on in the rats' brains. They wanted to figure out which the rats enjoyed more \u2014 eating cookies or being given drugs.\n\nSo they measured how active neurons were in the part of the rats' brain that feels pleasure. Neurons are nerve cells that carry \"messages\" in the brain. Rats and humans both have neurons. It turned out that the cookies activated many more neurons than the drugs did. In other words, the rats got more pleasure out of Oreos than cocaine.\n\nThis suggests that \"high-fat, high-sugar foods are addictive,\" Schroeder said.\n\nHard To Quit Eating High-Sugar Foods\nHonohan hopes people will learn something from the study. Maybe they will understand how hard it is to quit eating foods with a lot of fat and sugar.\n\nHonohan said that in some ways, junk foods may be \"more dangerous to society than drugs.\" This is because \"you don't have to go (into) a dark alley to buy them. You go into any grocery store or bodega.\" And they are cheap. The cost makes them attractive to poor people.\n\nAs for Oreos, Honohan is done with them. She used to eat them before the study. \"Now I can't even look at them,\" she said.",

The tickets are $115.00, parking is $10.00 and the entrance fee is $10.0 for a total of 115 + 10 + 10 = $135.00.\nThe answer: 135\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Seth and his brother want to see their favorite band in concert. The tickets are $50.00 each. There is a 15% processing fee for the tickets. They are also charged $10.00 for parking and an additional $5.00 per person entrance fee. How much will it cost to go to the concert?\n\n\nLovely will sell 10 x 2 / 5 = 4 books for $2.50 each. She will sell 10 - 4 = 6 books for $2 each. Her earnings for the 4 books at $2.50 will be $2.50 x 4 = $10. Her earnings for the 6 books for $2 each will be $2 x 6 = $12. Thus, Lovely's total earning if all 10 books are sold is $10 + $12 = $22.\nThe answer: 22\nReverse engineering the question: A yearly book sale is held in school where students can sell their old books at a cheaper price. Two-fifths of Lovely's books can be sold for $2.50 each and the rest for $2 each. How much will Lovely earn if all 10 books were sold?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: By the first two months, 20 / 100 * 200 = 40 mountains had erupted. The total number of mountains remaining after the first round of explosions is 200 - 40 = 160. When 40% of the remaining mountains exploded, the number of mountains that were still intact decreased by 40 / 100 * 160 = 64. The number of mountains that hadn't exploded after the second explosions is 160 - 64 = 96. When 50% of the mountains which were still intact exploded, the number of mountains that hadn't erupted was reduced by 50 / 100 * 96 = 48. At the end of the year, 96 - 48 = 48 mountains remained intact and hadn't exploded.\nThe answer: 48\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: A mountain range has 200 active volcanoes. In a particular year, 20% of the volcanoes exploded in the first two months, 40% of the remaining exploded by the half of the year, and at the end of the year, another 50% of the volcanoes that hadn't already erupted also exploded. How many mountains are still intact at the end of the year?\n\n\nTilly will make 100 x $10 = $1000 in total. She has spent $1000 - $300 = $700 on 100 bags. Each bag cost Tilly $700 / 100 = $7.\nThe answer: 7\nReverse engineering the question: Tilly needs to sell 100 bags at $10 per bag to make $300 in profit. How much did she buy each bag for?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: First find how many onions total Trent needs to chop: 4 onions / pot * 6 pots = 24 onions. Then divide that number by three onions per 2 tears to find how many sets of two tears Trent cries: 24 onions / 3 onions = 8. Then multiply that number by the number of tears per set to find the total number of tears: 8 * 2 tears = 16 tears.\nThe answer: 16\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Trent cries 2 tears for every three onions he chops. He needs to chop 4 onions per pot of soup. If he's making 6 pots of soup, how many tears does he cry?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24 minutes are accounted for.

        "prompt": "Here is a piece of text: After almost a decade of steady decline, the rate of students defaulting on college loans increased slightly in the latest year for which figures are available. Federal officials described that rise as statistically irrelevant, but some financial-aid observers said it is a potentially troubling turn.\nThe default rate climbed to 5.9 percent for fiscal year 2000, up from 5.6 percent the year before. That upward blip came after nine straight years of falling rates, from a peak of 22.4 percent in 1992.\nSome loan advocates said that while it was important to identify the possible causes behind the higher default rate, released Sept. 12, a single bad year wasn't enough to trouble them.\n\"With an increase that small, anything could have caused it, really,\" said Kenneth E. Redd, the director of research and policy analysis at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a Washington organization that assists colleges on loan issues. \"Next year's numbers will be a much greater indication of the default rate.\"\nAt this point, the increase was more likely to prompt interest on Capitol Hill than serious worry among financial-aid gurus, Mr. Redd speculated. Recent events seemed to bear that out. When the latest data were released, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of Education Rod Paige, asking for an explanation. Mr. Paige, in announcing the latest numbers, had linked the default increase partly to the poor economy's impact on borrowers.\n\"I am disturbed that the default rate has increased after nine straight years of decline,\" Rep. Miller said in a statement, warning that the Department of Education should guard against increases \"reminiscent of the 1980s and early 1990s.\"\nEllynne Bannon, an advocate for the State Public Interest Research Group, a consumer-watchdog organization in Washington, voiced concern about default rates creeping upward as students are piling up more debt than ever. Average student-loan debt rose to $16,928 in 1999-2000, almost twice the amount as eight years before, according to Education Department data.\n\"When you think about the two things together, that could give you cause for concern,\" Ms. Bannon said.\nEducation Department officials acknowledged that higher debt and rising tuition are having an impact on students. But while promising to respond to Rep. Miller, Jeff Andrade, the department's deputy assistant secretary for postsecondary education, also said the higher default rate might simply reflect minor shifts in the pool of student borrowers and institutions.\nOverall, the low rates tell a story of success, Mr. Andrade said: The department has given schools and private lenders more flexibility in dealing with students who fall behind on loans, while continuing to crack down on schools that failed to counsel students on default.\n\"There is a heightened awareness on college campuses that loans have to be repaid on time,\" Mr. Andrade said.\nThe national default rate measures loans made to students at about 6,400 higher education institutions who participate in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and the Family Federal Education Loan Program. The former program allows students at participating schools to borrow directly from the federal government; the latter provides access to federally guaranteed loans from private lenders.\nStudents, who generally are required to begin repayment six to nine months after graduating or quitting school, are considered in default after 270 days without a payment. The latest estimates represent those with payments due on Oct. 1, 1999, who defaulted sometime before Sept. 30, 2001.\nWhile the federal government administers loans, colleges and universities bear much of the legal responsibility for counseling students on how to manage their debt. In the 1980s and 1990s, Congress increased this obligation, and gave the Education Department more power to cut off schools from loan programs.\nOver the past decade, agency officials have barred nearly 1,200 schools from federal student-loan programs because of high default rates, including five who stand to lose eligibility this year.\nDefault rates below 6 percent were \"almost an optimum\" level, or about the lowest possible, said Deputy Secretary of Education William D. Hansen.

The Danes are celebrating the completion of the Hall, and theyre really boozing it up and partying quite loudly. Booziest of all is Hrothgar himself quite inebriated, half-naked, slurring his words and barely able to keep his balance. He's somewhat repulsive and a bit of an embarrassment to his young wife, Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).The revelers begin to chant, pounding the ground in time with the chanting. The camera pulls away from the Hall, to the snowy hills surrounding the kingdom, where the chanting and thumping have died out and all is silent. Finally, we pull into a cave miles away, where the chanting and thumping are suddenly heard at an almost unbearably loud level. We hear something in the cave screaming in pain, as if the noise is too much for it to bear.Back to Heorot, where after-hours are still rocking full-blast. The large wooden entrance doors are blasted off their hinges, the halls torches blow out, and the hearth in the middle of the hall erupts in eerie blue flames. People start wigging, as we hear same the something from the cave screaming right outside Heorot's doorway. As the Danes gird their loins and take up arms, the creature enters.It's huge, about 15 feet tall and vaguely humanoid in appearance, but clearly not all human. Its misshapen, deformed, and appears to have, instead of ears, some highly sensitive pads that serve as hearing organs. The screaming of the Danes seems to hurt the creatures ears and, enraged, he begins to tear the revelers apart, literally.Eventually, the creature makes his way to Hrothgar, who, to his credit, didn't run away in a drunken panic, but held his ground. The King demands that the monster fight him, but the creature is unafraid. It simply takes a long almost quizzical look at Hrothgar and abruptly withdraws.Back at his cave, the monster is chastised by his mother for killing men. We don't see his mother, though we catch...\nA:",

Known as the 'angel of the snow,' he was at one time the fastest man on skis having broken the speed record. As well as instructing numerous royals, he was also the first coach of the Italian national ski team. He appeared in several films, wrote books on skiing, modelled ski fashion and designed his own clothing line in his hometown of Cervinia. Like many famous Alpine natives, skiing was more than just a sport for Gasperl - it was a life necessity. As a young boy, he skied to school from his parent's house in the forest, every morning!\nTo emulate this look you'll need to visit Ralph Lauren (jumper, sunglasses, gloves), John Smedley (rollneck), Moncler Grenoble (trousers) and James Lock & Co (cap).

With no way to return to their home planet, the Newcomers were first quarantined and then finally released to live among humans in the LA area.An LA police detective, Matthew Sykes, and his partner, Detective Tuggle, are patrolling an LA Newcomer neighborhood when they spot two of the aliens dressed in long black coats entering a small convenience store.

Your task is to generate answer \"yes\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \"no\".\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Review: I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years, especially \"Strictly Ballroom\". While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing. It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch. Question: is it a positive review?\nStudent:",
        "response": "Yes. The review is a positive review as it expresses appreciation for the film and highlights its positive aspects, including its well-done production and the enjoyment it provides to the audience despite low expectations going into the viewing. It also compares it positively to other recent dance-themed movies and praises its cultural insights and intriguing cultural contrasts, which further enhance the film's appeal and make it a fun viewing experience for the reviewer and potential moviegoers. It ultimately recommends and promotes the film, which is a hallmark of a positive and enthusiastic review that recommends the subject of the review and encourages others to experience it as well."

        "prompt": "Read the following context and answer the question. Context: So this thing happened today. I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. Question: The author probably believes that Answer:\n\n (i) Daimond masi is lazy. (ii) Diamond masi is a good worker. (iii) Diamond masi is not a house cleaner. (iv) not enough information.\nThe answer is:",
        "response": "The author most likely believes that Diamond masi is not a hardworking sweeper who rarely cleans the road and rarely takes the waste from the homes she is supposed to clean and also rarely comes to work and often gives excuses for her absences or poor quality of work she has been hired to do. She also often asks for money from the society's residents under the false pretense that her family members are seriously ill and she desperately needs financial help which sometimes goes up to Rs. 10,000 even if it is not the actual case.

        "prompt": "Given the text: We've got roughly another week before Dodge reveals its hellish Challenger Demon, but Hennessey has already produced a rival. It's called the Exorcist, and both the name and Hennessey's press release make it clear the car is designed to be the anti-Demon. That may not come across visually, since on the surface it's just a standard Camaro ZL1 with decals. But underneath is an LT4 V8 tuned to 1,000 horsepower and 966 lb-ft of torque.\nTo hit those lofty outputs, Hennessey ditched the standard supercharger for a bigger one and added an upgraded intercooler. The company also fitted a more aggressive camshaft, ported heads, long-tube headers, and tuned the ECU. Coupled with drag tires, Hennessey claims the Exorcist is good for a 0-60 mph time of under 3 seconds and a quarter-mile time of under 10 seconds. And Hennessey will sell you a set of drag radials to help you achieve those times, but like the rest of the package it'll cost you.\nThe complete package, including the Exorcist decals, rings in at $55,000 \u2013 and that's on top of the Camaro ZL1 you have to supply. Unless you already have one or picked up a used or discounted example, the least you'll pay for an Exorcist is just over $118,000. And if you want Hennessey to upgrade an automatic, you'll be spending another $9,950 to upgrade the transmission. On the plus side, the Exorcist upgrade does come with a 2 year/24,000 mile warranty. It's also going to be an exclusive vehicle, with only 100 built each year. The company offers a couple of options, too. For $8,995 you can get a drag pack with two wheels shod in Nitto drag tires along with a floor jack, tool kit, and upgraded driveshaft. And if track driving is more your style, the road race pack comes with a set of lightweight wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for $6,995.\nThe Hennessey Exorcist is certainly an impressive machine. And the video of it smoking tires is certainly entertaining. However, it's probably still worth waiting a week before ordering one to see what the Challenger Demon will be like. And if you're a bow-tie booster, you may still want to wait, since the ZL1 1LE is on its way and will likely be the better road course toy \u2013 though the Exorcist would likely stomp it on the drag strip.\nWhat additional upgrades can be purchased for the Hennessey Exorcist, and what are their prices?",
