Question: What is another word for average? Context: The problem of the direction of time arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is not time-reversal invariant. Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future.\nAnswer: directly\n\n[Q]: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what is the last military branch mentioned? Context: The Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin, rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812. His army walked through snow up to their knees and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After Battle of Berezina Napoleon succeeded to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.\n****\n[A]: army\n\ninput: Please answer the following: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

On April 2, 1865, General Godfrey Weitzel, commander of the 25th corps of the United States Colored Troops, accepted the city's surrender from the mayor and group of leading citizens who remained. The Union troops eventually managed to stop the raging fires but about 25% of the city's buildings were destroyed-\n++++++++++\noutput: The Union troops\n\nPlease answer this: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What are usually found in mainframe computers? Context: Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.\n++++++++\nAnswer: several CPUs\n\nQuestion: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was the main goal of the Ottomans? Context: The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous. The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact.\nAnswer:",

        "prompt": "Q: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"sympathetic\" and \"stern\") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.\nContext Word: advantage.\nA:",
