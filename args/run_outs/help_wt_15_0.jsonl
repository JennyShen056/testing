Question: What is another word for average? Context: The problem of the direction of time arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process.

Question: what is the last military branch mentioned? Context: The Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin, rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812. His army walked through snow up to their knees and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After Battle of Berezina Napoleon succeeded to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train.

While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet.

It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it.

My husband and I travelled in Romania in August 2013. For a special dinner party back home I tried some of Ellie's Romanian recipes -- Cozonac, Salata de Varza Rosie, Ostropel and Mititei. ALL WONDERFUL. We had such a good time -- Roger and I sharing some of our adventures and sharing food with family and friends. So happy you enjoyed making the Romanian dishes... it made my day just knowing you tried the recipes:). Thank you so much for your feedback, I really appreciate it! It means a ton to me that you took the time to write... glad you stopped by:)! Dear Ellie!!! I´m so happy that I found your Blog…. On saturday I have invited the ambassador of Romania and his wife… Looking for Romanian recipes I found you!!!! I´m going to try several of your recipes!!! Anita, I am so happy you stopped by.:)! I can only hope that you find the recipes somewhat similar to your mom's cooking. I definitely can't promise it's close to your mom's recipes, because mom's cooking is always best... but maybe they can be a good starting point... and as you cook, you can easily adjust taste to your liking. Oh, Ana... my eyes watered when I read your kind email. Thank you for your kind words, they warmed my heart with thankfulness to the LORD for people like you. I really appreciate you stopping by and sharing. I am so glad God uses my blog to inspire and bring you memories of your growing up years in Romania. Was thrilled to hear that you made it to Montana! Montana is indeed a beautiful state... just these past several weeks I've been in awe with the changing colors... such a beautiful sight to behold... the red, orange, yellow and green leaves signaling that Fall has officially arrived. I never tire of the different seasonal changes here. May God continue to use your cooking talent to serve others. And as you said, HE gave us the cooking to be used for HIS glory. May you enjoy the rest of your vacation here in Montana... God bless your hands in the kitchen as you lovingly take care of your family. And you are always welcome here to read, try a recipe or two or just to reminisce about your beautiful time in Romania. I always love to hear from my readers:). Much love to you! I am in awe of the photos of Montana. I think you live in Paradise. I came to your site when I discovered the Japanese Milk Bread Recipe. I search for recipes on the Internet almost daily because I love to Cook/Bake and try new Recipes. I wanted to try it out your recipe because I have a Friend who has a Daughter-in-Law who is Japanese. My friend - is a Real Estate agent searching for a house for us. So when I saw the recipe for Japanese Milk Bread I sent him the Recipe because he loves everything Japanese after visiting there a few years ago. I am English born Canadian but lived in an Acadian Village for several years - Isn't t great how all our cultures and languages are coming together from your Recipe Site? I will be trying the Japanese Milk Bread soon. Your Love and Devotion to the Lord shines out in your words and recipes. How different from many other sites. And it is a reminder to me of how I have neglected the Lord in my life lately and how I need to focus on him with ALL MY HEART AND SOUL. Was it God who led me to your site to lead me back to him - I would say yes. It touched me so much. It was his unmistakable hand - a gentle reminder of what I can yet do for him in my life if I once again give it over to him. God bless you... and thanks so much for stopping by and taking the time to write such an encouraging comment! It was such a delight to hear from you. I was simply touched with your comment, and I know the Lord used you to strengthen my faith in Him. He is ever so kind to let us know how He sometimes uses us in ways unbeknownst to us. I am grateful to know that the blog has been of help to you, not only in searching for recipes, but as a reminder to draw nearer to the Lord God(which is of eternal importance). I sure hope you enjoy making the a Japanese bread... it is wonderfully light and airy. My husband and I have had the privilege of visiting Japan twice now and it is one place I would love to visit again. Hopefully your friend's daughter in law will enjoy a slice or two of the bread:)... how fun to hear that you love to cook and bake! Stephanie, I pray the Lord will direct your heart and soul to grow in the knowledge of Hin through His Word... that you may be a Light unto Him there where He has placed you. May He richly bless you... and thanks again for stopping by!", "result": "Which Romanian dishes did Nellie try and love when travelling in Romania in 2013?

The study was run by science professor Joseph Schroeder and his students. It used rats to test foods with a lot of fat and sugar in them, to see if the foods might be making people addicted. In other words, would it be really hard for people to stop eating those foods?\n\nThe results? Rats seemed to like cookies as much as cocaine.\n\nThe study shows that foods with a lot of fat and sugar do the same thing to the brain that drugs do, Schroeder said. That may explain why some people can't stop eating them, even when \"they know they are bad for them.\"\n\nRats Race To Oreos\nThe study was thought up by college student Jamie Honohan.\n\nHonohan wondered why so many poor people are obese — that is, very overweight. She wanted to test the idea that high-fat, high-sugar foods are as addictive as drugs.\n\nThere was a reason Oreos were chosen, Schroeder said. The researchers wanted something that was tasty for humans as well as rats. That way the study would say something about \"a problem facing humans.\"\n\nHonohan said she also wanted to use something common in grocery stores. Plus, she noted, rats really like Oreos.\n\nThe researchers set up two little rooms for the rats. Then, they tried several different experiments.\n\nIn one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one space and rice cakes in the other. It was clear that the rats preferred the Oreos, she said. They split the cookies apart and gobbled up the cream. Then, they went on to eat all the cookies. Not all the rice cakes got eaten.\n\nAfter this, the food was removed. The rats were given the choice of where to spend time. They spent far more time in the room where the Oreos had been, than where the rice cakes had been.\n\nRats Get A Sugar High\nThe researchers did the same experiment with drugs. Rats were given a shot of cocaine in one room. And in the other room, they were injected with salt water. Then the shots were stopped. The rats were given the choice of which room to spend time in. They liked the room where the drugs had been better.\n\nWhat did the researchers observe? The rats spent as many hours in the Oreos room as they did in the drug room.\n\nThen the researchers looked at what was going on in the rats' brains. They wanted to figure out which the rats enjoyed more — eating cookies or being given drugs.\n\nSo they measured how active neurons were in the part of the rats' brain that feels pleasure. Neurons are nerve cells that carry \"messages\" in the brain. Rats and humans both have neurons. It turned out that the cookies activated many more neurons than the drugs did. In other words, the rats got more pleasure out of Oreos than cocaine.\n\nThis suggests that \"high-fat, high-sugar foods are addictive,\" Schroeder said.\n\nHard To Quit Eating High-Sugar Foods\nHonohan hopes people will learn something from the study. Maybe they will understand how hard it is to quit eating foods with a lot of fat and sugar.\n\nHonohan said that in some ways, junk foods may be \"more dangerous to society than drugs.\" This is because \"you don't have to go (into) a dark alley to buy them. You go into any grocery store or bodega.\" And they are cheap. The cost makes them attractive to poor people.\n\nAs for Oreos, Honohan is done with them.

Maybe they will understand how hard it is to quit eating foods with a lot of fat and sugar.\n\nHonohan said that in some ways, junk foods may be \"more dangerous to society than drugs.\" This is because \"you don't have to go (into) a dark alley to buy them. You go into any grocery store or bodega.\" And they are cheap. The cost makes them attractive to poor people.\n\nAs for Oreos, Honohan is done with them. She used to eat them before the study. \"Now I can't even look at them,\" she said.Researchers at the University of North Carolina at the Institute for Obesity and the Neuroscience of Weight Regulation conducted a study comparing Oreos, a popular snack food with a high sugar and fat content, and cocaine. The study used a test called the \"preference tube test\" which allowed researchers to measure which substance the rats preferred. The researchers found that the rats preferred the sweet, creamy, and crunchy flavor of the chocolate cream-filled, sugar and fat-filled, and salty snack food called the Oreo cookie. The researchers used the Oreo because it contains a high amount of sucrose, which makes the sweet and creamy, and", "response": "Researchers at the University of North Carolina at the Institute for Obesity and the Neuroscience of Weight Regulation conducted a study comparing Oreos, a popular snack food with a high sugar and fat content, and cocaine.

This is a good question.\nQ: Passage: 夏威夷秧鸡（）是夏威夷岛一种神秘的秧鸡，但现已灭绝。牠们不懂得飞，生活在灌丛带。在普纳地区附近发现了几个夏威夷秧鸡的标本，包括一些较深色及一些较浅色而有斑点的标本。最先采集的夏威夷秧鸡标本是较为浅色的形态，共有五个标本，分别存放在莱顿的荷兰国家自然科学博物馆及纽约的美国自然历史博物馆。另外几个较深色形态的标本则存放在剑桥的大学自然历史博物馆、伦敦的自然历史博物馆、维也纳、纽约及檀香山的毕晓普博物馆。1778年绘画的一幅图画中是较浅色的夏威夷秧鸡，有可能就是莱顿的标本。近年亦有发现牠们的亚化石。由于夏威夷秧鸡有两种形态，造成了很多混淆。根据采集夏威夷秧鸡标本的过程，牠们最有可能生活在欧胡岛及考艾岛，而考艾岛亦曾有一种类似体型的动物出现。不过考艾岛发现的骨头却属于较大体型的，而夏威夷秧鸡的标本则较细小。在夏威夷岛发现了一种较细小的田鸡属亚化石，但其大小只如雷仙岛秧鸡。另外在凯卢阿-科纳亦发现一些骨头，约较夏威夷秧鸡大15%。一般接受较浅色的形态是未成年的夏威夷秧鸡，但却仍有待DNA研究证实。不论如何，浅色及深色的形态都被认为是同一物种，一些异名如下：最后五个异名是指深色的形态。当中\"Rallus obscurus\"在被描述时仍未有发现深色的形态，描述有可能是根据在莱斯特大宅的标本而造的。夏威夷秧鸡浅色形态的标本是于1778年在詹姆斯·库克（James Cook）的第三次旅程采集的，相信于当时并没有发现深色的形态。大部份或全部深色形态的标本都是于1860年至1864年采集的。最近证实见到夏威夷秧鸡是于1884年，另一个存疑的观察则是于1893年。1887年的搜寻未能发现牠们，不过却不足以确定牠们的灭绝。夏威夷秧鸡的灭绝可能是因入侵的大家鼠、猫及狗。狩猎亦可能是其中一种原因。\nA:在什么地区附近曾经发掘到最先采集的夏威夷秧鸡标本的标本样本？user\n\nDetailed Instructions: Given reviews from Amazon and a category, the task here is to classify whether the review given belongs to the category.

It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch.

Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch. Question: is it a positive review?\nStudent:Yes. This review has a positive sentiment towards the movie and describes the reviewer's pleasantly surprising and enjoyable experience while also highlighting cultural contrasts and intriguing aspects of the film and its dancing. It also mentions that the reviewer found the movie to be a fun and engaging viewing that exceeded their low expectations, which further supports a positive sentiment towards the movie and its overall entertainment value for the audience. The review also touches upon cultural differences and imports that make the movie interesting to watch and appreciate as a cultural exchange and learning experience for the international audience and the Japanese culture it portrays and presents to the global cinema and entertainment industry and its diverse audience", "response": "Yes.

It's called the Exorcist, and both the name and Hennessey's press release make it clear the car is designed to be the anti-Demon. That may not come across visually, since on the surface it's just a standard Camaro ZL1 with decals. But underneath is an LT4 V8 tuned to 1,000 horsepower and 966 lb-ft of torque.\nTo hit those lofty outputs, Hennessey ditched the standard supercharger for a bigger one and added an upgraded intercooler. The company also fitted a more aggressive camshaft, ported heads, long-tube headers, and tuned the ECU. Coupled with drag tires, Hennessey claims the Exorcist is good for a 0-60 mph time of under 3 seconds and a quarter-mile time of under 10 seconds. And Hennessey will sell you a set of drag radials to help you achieve those times, but like the rest of the package it'll cost you.\nThe complete package, including the Exorcist decals, rings in at $55,000 – and that's on top of the Camaro ZL1 you have to supply. Unless you already have one or picked up a used or discounted example, the least you'll pay for an Exorcist is just over $118,000. And if you want Hennessey to upgrade an automatic, you'll be spending another $9,950 to upgrade the transmission. On the plus side, the Exorcist upgrade does come with a 2 year/24,000 mile warranty. It's also going to be an exclusive vehicle, with only 100 built each year. The company offers a couple of options, too. For $8,995 you can get a drag pack with two wheels shod in Nitto drag tires along with a floor jack, tool kit, and upgraded driveshaft. And if track driving is more your style, the road race pack comes with a set of lightweight wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for $6,995.\nThe Hennessey Exorcist is certainly an impressive machine. And the video of it smoking tires is certainly entertaining. However, it's probably still worth waiting a week before ordering one to see what the Challenger Demon will be like. And if you're a bow-tie booster, you may still want to wait, since the ZL1 1LE is on its way and will likely be the better road course toy – though the Exorcist would likely stomp it on the drag strip.\nWhat additional upgrades can be purchased for the Hennessey Exorcist, and what are their prices?", "result": "Given the text: We've got roughly another week before Dodge reveals its hellish Challenger Demon, but Hennessey has already produced a rival.

Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.  This is indie rock at it's finest.  The production takes this album up to new great heights.  This album is similar to The Forbidden Love EP, which is also good.  In my opinion, We Have The Facts, and The Photo Album demonstrate Death Cab's early raw style, where everything was understated simply and beautifully, before the overproduced Transatlanticism and Plans.  This is a great album to listen to if you want to relax, or just think.  As they continue to develop as artists, it's amazing to watch their sound change, for better or for worse.  Recommended.\nOutput:", "result": "Definition: In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

I buy them from the well-known brand, but only their special range for Halloween or Christmas as their usual fancies aren’t vegetarian. The red food colouring they use is not vegetarian.\nI wanted to make fondant fancies at home for a long time, but there are so many things I want to try and they are time consuming to make. When the showstopper of the Patisserie Week was fondant fancies, I had to make them. My husband said he would like coffee fancies and he had a great idea. I made a fat-less sponge with mascarpone coffee cream and white icing.\nMake the sponge because it needs time to cool before cutting. Preheat the oven at 180C or 160C fan. Whisk the egg whites with the hand mixer until they hold firm peaks. Mix the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and thick. Incorporate the egg yolk mixture and the flour into the egg white mixture by carefully folding them in.\nOn the baking tray, put the baking paper lining and spray a little bit of oil. Tip the mixture and spread it evenly with a knife. Bake for 25 – 30 minutes. The sponge is ready when it springs back to touch. When is baked, take it out of the oven and leave it for a minute or two, then remove it from the tray. Leave it on a cooling rack until is cold.\nMake the mascarpone cream by mixing the butter with a little bit of the icing sugar. Add the mascarpone and the rest of the sugar and mix. In a small bowl, put the instant coffee and a spoon of boiling water to dissolve it. Add more boiling water if it’s needed. When the coffee has dissolved completely, pour it over the cream and mix again. Mix until the coffee is incorporated. You can chill the cream in the fridge until used.\nCut the sponge in small pieces. Put cling film on a big baking tray and put the cooling rack on top of the tray. Sandwich two pieces of sponge together with cream. Cover the fancie with cream. Place them on the cooling rack.\nMake the icing by mixing the fondant icing with the hand mixer. Add 40g cold water and mix until the icing is smooth. Check the consistency and add more water to make it suitable for pouring. Don’t add too much or it will be too thin. Pour the icing on all the fancies. Using a coffee stencil template, make the shapes on top of the fancies with dusted cocoa.\nThey look gorgeous Anca, love the little heart shape on top. Shame Mr Kiplin doen’t source a vegetarian red for their fondant fancies isn’t it!?\nYes, it’s a shame. I hope they will change it in time as there are local available options and quite affordable. I mean beetroot.\nLove these they really remind me of a tiramisu too with the coffee on top.\nThese look fabulous – the design is very cute too.

It's a great, cruelty and chemical-fume-free, and more natural and sustainable option that also adds a lovely, slightly fruity and slightly earthy flavor that goes quite well with the mascarpone and white icing.

Definition\nIn this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

The trigger words are \"large\" and \"small\". Everything else (apart from the trigger words) are the same in the two sentences. The two sentences have different answers, which are the two objects (\"trophy\" and \"suitcase\").\nPart 3. Exercise\nContext Word: orphaned.\nAnswer:", "result": "Part 1. Definition\nIn this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n\nPart 2.

Exercise\nContext Word: orphaned.\nAnswer:Sentence 1: The orphaned calf was taken care of by the cowherd due to the sudden death of its mother, which left the cowherd heart-wrenchingly alone and emotionally bereft.

This can be quite frustrating, especially when you take the time and spend the money to create a well designed website.\nEven the best SEO practices can’t take into account the one factor that can “fudge everything up” – humans. At the end of every search query, at the end of over click, there is a human who is controlling it all. It is fascinating at times to watch how we behave, and to try and apply some reasoning and logic behind why we do everything that we do.\nIf you have ever built a site or added pages to an existing site and had to wait ages for it to get indexed, you likely felt a great deal of frustration. You can only make money if your site shows up in search engines. Indexing is important, and it is hard to sit back and wait for Google.\nWhat’s Your SEO Risk Level?\nI’ve done it; you’ve done it; probably a lot of your friends have done it as well.

When your heart starts beating so much that you can feel a thumping  in your throat, it may feel like you \"have your heart in your mouth\". Have Butterflies in the Stomach How did butterflies get in your stomach? Well, those really aren't butterflies in there. It is a way of describing those nervous feelings you might get before a test or a very important decision. These stomach flutters   are normal and happen to many people. Some people believe having a few butterflies might even help you perform better. Sick as a Dog If you've ever been very sick, you may have used this expression. Because dogs eat just about anything they find, they often get sick. So it's all right to describe someone who's not feeling well as being \"sick as a dog\" . Under the Weather When it's rainy all day outside, how would you feel? This expression comes from the idea that bad weather might hurt a person's health and mood .

When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good. The color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'. Some people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful (  ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the 'black' expressions have bad meaning. A company 'in the red' is losing money.

Schwartz Federal Courthouse. \n\nNo one was injured in the blast that damaged the building's front lobby, shattered a glass door and broke a window in a building across the street. \n\nLove could face between 30 years and life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Sheppard. \n\nDuring the two-week trial, prosecutors painted Love as the mastermind behind the blast. \n\nHe directed two others, Rachelle Lynette Carlock and Ella Louise Sanders to purchase explosive powder and to steal bomb-making materials, they said. Carlock was an on-again, off-again girlfriend to Love, said Sheppard. \n\nAccording to testimony, Carlock and Eric Reginald Robinson then drove from Love's house to San Diego with a backpack, containing three pipe bombs. Carlock detonated the bombs at the front doors of the courthouse, prosecutors said. \n\nCarlock, Sanders and Robinson were charged and each previously pleaded guilty for their parts in the plan. \n\nAt the time of the bombing, Love was in \"dire financial straits,\" prosecutors said, and faced jail time stemming from two pending criminal cases. \n\n\"The evidence showed that he directed the May 4, 2008, bombing for the purpose of obtaining reward money and a break on his state charges by providing information about the bombing to law enforcement,\" prosecutors said in a statement. \n[A]: Who was found guilty of 10 charges?\n\n\n[Q]: (CNN)Prison life won't be pretty for Aaron Hernandez, the former NFL player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole. \n\nAfter correction officers evaluate him, he will be shipped to Massachusetts' flagship maximum-security prison, one of the most high-tech jails in the United States with no history of breakouts: the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, about 40 miles outside downtown Boston. \n\nIt's called Souza, for short, and it's the state's newest prison, opened in 1998, with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire. \n\n\"I don't know the date, but he'll be going there.

Schwartz Federal Courthouse. \n\nNo one was injured in the blast that damaged the building's front lobby, shattered a glass door and broke a window in a building across the street. \n\nLove could face between 30 years and life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Sheppard. \n\nDuring the two-week trial, prosecutors painted Love as the mastermind behind the blast. \n\nHe directed two others, Rachelle Lynette Carlock and Ella Louise Sanders to purchase explosive powder and to steal bomb-making materials, they said. Carlock was an on-again, off-again girlfriend to Love, said Sheppard. \n\nAccording to testimony, Carlock and Eric Reginald Robinson then drove from Love's house to San Diego with a backpack, containing three pipe bombs. Carlock detonated the bombs at the front doors of the courthouse, prosecutors said. \n\nCarlock, Sanders and Robinson were charged and each previously pleaded guilty for their parts in the plan. \n\nAt the time of the bombing, Love was in \"dire financial straits,\" prosecutors said, and faced jail time stemming from two pending criminal cases. \n\n\"The evidence showed that he directed the May 4, 2008, bombing for the purpose of obtaining reward money and a break on his state charges by providing information about the bombing to law enforcement,\" prosecutors said in a statement. \n[A]: Who was found guilty of 10 charges?\n\n\n[Q]: (CNN)Prison life won't be pretty for Aaron Hernandez, the former NFL player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole. \n\nAfter correction officers evaluate him, he will be shipped to Massachusetts' flagship maximum-security prison, one of the most high-tech jails in the United States with no history of breakouts: the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, about 40 miles outside downtown Boston. \n\nIt's called Souza, for short, and it's the state's newest prison, opened in 1998, with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire. \n\n\"I don't know the date, but he'll be going there.

A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. The data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor MRI provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.\nOutput: Microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.\nThis title is appropriate for the given abstract because the focus of this abstract is cerebral white matter assesment.\n\nNew input case for you: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that results from cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells. In T1DM animal models, it has been shown that the systemic administration of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, also referred as to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), results in the regeneration of pancreatic islets. Mechanisms underlying this effect are still poorly understood. Our aims were to assess whether donor MSCs (a) differentiate into pancreatic β-cells and (b) modify systemic and pancreatic pathophysiologic markers of T1DM. After the intravenous administration of 5 × 10(5) syngeneic MSCs, we observed that mice with T1DM reverted their hyperglycemia and presented no donor-derived insulin-producing cells. In contrast, 7 and 65 days post-transplantation, MSCs were engrafted into secondary lymphoid organs. This correlated with a systemic and local reduction in the abundance of autoaggressive T cells together with an increase in regulatory T cells. Additionally, in the pancreas of mice with T1DM treated with MSCs, we observed a cytokine profile shift from proinflammatory to antinflammatory. MSC transplantation did not reduce pancreatic cell apoptosis but recovered local expression and increased the circulating levels of epidermal growth factor, a pancreatic trophic factor. Therefore, the antidiabetic effect of MSCs intravenously administered is unrelated to their transdifferentiation potential but to their capability to restore the balance between Th1 and Th2 immunological responses along with the modification of the pancreatic microenvironment. Our data should be taken into account when designing clinical trials aimed to evaluate MSC transplantation in patients with T1DM since the presence of endogenous precursors seems to be critical in order to restore glycemic control.\nOutput:", "result": "Given the task definition, example input & output, solve the new input case.\nIn this task, you are given an abstract of article.
