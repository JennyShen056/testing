[{"prompt": "How does spaghetti squash compare to traditional pasta in terms of nutritional content and calorie count, and what are some potential health benefits? Generate according to: Golden yellow and oval shaped, spaghetti squash usually weighs about 4 to 8 pounds. When cooked, the inside looks just like spaghetti and can be prepared in the same way. A great way to get your veggies, spaghetti squash is rich in nutrients including potassium, vitamin A, beta carotene and folic acid and can be substituted for spaghetti in any pasta dish. It's lower in calories than pasta and not nearly as heavy so you don't feel like you've eaten too much afterwards as sometimes happens with pasta. Spaghetti squash can be served as a main course with marinara sauce and meatballs, just as you would serve spaghetti (pasta). Or, make it a side vegetable with roast beef, pork or fish. Toss it with butter for a simple side or add your own mixture of herbs and spices. It also adds a nice texture and color to any salad. When selecting a squash look for a pale yellow color with no bruises or soft spots. Avoid the ones that still have some green skin as they would not have matured yet. Spaghetti squash can be baked, boiled, steamed or microwaved. The skin of an uncooked squash is thick and tough making it difficult to peel (practically impossible) or cut with a knife. I find it's easiest to bake it whole. Using a fork remove the spaghetti strands, they separate easily. Serve your spaghetti squash in any of these colorful dishes. A touch of Italy or beautiful Mexico inspired bright tones. Keep it simple with images of vegetables and herbs. Use them for soup, cereal, salad...anything at all! These Pyrex baking dishes are just what you'll need for spaghetti squash. They can go in the oven, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and microwave. Use them for baking cakes, lasagna, casseroles and lots more. It's lighter than pasta but can be served with the same sauces you would use for spaghetti. Spaghetti squash salad is a great idea! I'll experiment with that. I drink water with meals, but I suppose white or red wine would be nice depending on the sauce. candy47, Do you have any spaghetti squash salad recipes? What do you serve for drinks with your fresh and heated versions? I'm glad you had a pleasant memory Brenda marie. Yes MBC, healthier and lighter than pasta. You don't feel 'heavy' after eating spaghetti squash. I love spaghetti Squash! And it's healthier than pasta. I've had spaghetti squash a few times - it's definitely a vegetable version of spaghetti! Happy that this article reminded me it's in season again right now.

In particular, kudos to the quality of the sound reproduction, which I've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones.\nquestion: How bad is the sound?\nwhich I 've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones\n\nreview: The Prestige (2006)Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David BowieChristopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless.

The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is.

The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

M: Well, we have to walk down this road, take the first turning on the left. Then walk until we come to the river and... W: The river? M: Yes. It's over there, and there's a bridge. Across the bridge, we will be able to see some road signs which will tell us the way. W: But how far is it? How long does it take to walk there? M: About fifteen minutes, if we walk quickly. W: Fifteen minutes! We may be late for the train. And with these heavy bags, too! I think we ought to take a taxi. M: Not at this hour. Look at the traffic. It's moving very slowly. We can get there just as quickly on foot. W: Well, I can't possibly carry this bag any farther. M: All right. Let me take it, then. W: Don't be silly. You can't carry two bags at the same time. M: Yes, I can. The bags aren't that heavy...hmm! W: You see! They're heavier than you thought! M: Perhaps it's not such a bad idea after all. W: What isn't such a bad idea? What do you mean? M: Taxi!

Answer according to: Big shifts in trade and shipping trends are crashing together at the Port of Hong Kong. The city’s antitrust watchdog is investigating cartel allegations against the port’s biggest terminal operators, the WSJ’s Costas Paris and Joanne Chiu report, in a sign of how Hong Kong’s receding role in global shipping is creating conflicts on the docks. The antitrust investigation is over plans by the port’s top four terminal handlers to work together under an alliance that would operate berths controlling 95% of Hong Kong’s container volume. The operators aim to get more efficient, but the big goal is to reclaim container business that’s been lost to other fast-growing Asian gateways, particularly China’s big seaports. The new response at Hong Kong’s docks is creating a showdown between the terminal operators and cargo owners who say the strategy is simply a monopoly aimed at driving up costs for shippers.\nWarehouse developers simply can’t build fast enough to catch up with demand. The availability of industrial space fell to its lowest point since 2000 in the fourth quarter, the WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, and the gap between demand and supply grew wider in the second half of the year.

At least 15 tankers were idling in the Gulf waiting to unload million barrels of gasoline in recent days, apparently the result of the president’s decision to shut down several key pipelines that carry the fuel inland from coastal terminals and refineries. The move is meant to combat fuel theft that cost state oil firm Pemex roughly $3 billion last year.
