[{"prompt": "How does spaghetti squash compare to traditional pasta in terms of nutritional content and calorie count, and what are some potential health benefits? Generate according to: Golden yellow and oval shaped, spaghetti squash usually weighs about 4 to 8 pounds. When cooked, the inside looks just like spaghetti and can be prepared in the same way. A great way to get your veggies, spaghetti squash is rich in nutrients including potassium, vitamin A, beta carotene and folic acid and can be substituted for spaghetti in any pasta dish. It's lower in calories than pasta and not nearly as heavy so you don't feel like you've eaten too much afterwards as sometimes happens with pasta. Spaghetti squash can be served as a main course with marinara sauce and meatballs, just as you would serve spaghetti (pasta). Or, make it a side vegetable with roast beef, pork or fish. Toss it with butter for a simple side or add your own mixture of herbs and spices. It also adds a nice texture and color to any salad. When selecting a squash look for a pale yellow color with no bruises or soft spots. Avoid the ones that still have some green skin as they would not have matured yet. Spaghetti squash can be baked, boiled, steamed or microwaved. The skin of an uncooked squash is thick and tough making it difficult to peel (practically impossible) or cut with a knife. I find it's easiest to bake it whole. Using a fork remove the spaghetti strands, they separate easily. Serve your spaghetti squash in any of these colorful dishes. A touch of Italy or beautiful Mexico inspired bright tones. Keep it simple with images of vegetables and herbs. Use them for soup, cereal, salad...anything at all! These Pyrex baking dishes are just what you'll need for spaghetti squash. They can go in the oven, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and microwave. Use them for baking cakes, lasagna, casseroles and lots more. It's lighter than pasta but can be served with the same sauces you would use for spaghetti. Spaghetti squash salad is a great idea! I'll experiment with that. I drink water with meals, but I suppose white or red wine would be nice depending on the sauce. candy47, Do you have any spaghetti squash salad recipes? What do you serve for drinks with your fresh and heated versions? I'm glad you had a pleasant memory Brenda marie. Yes MBC, healthier and lighter than pasta. You don't feel 'heavy' after eating spaghetti squash. I love spaghetti Squash! And it's healthier than pasta. I've had spaghetti squash a few times - it's definitely a vegetable version of spaghetti! Happy that this article reminded me it's in season again right now. Ideal for small living spaces or limited outdoor planting areas, indoor herb gardens will provide freshly picked herbs all year round.", "result": "How does spaghetti squash compare to traditional pasta in terms of nutritional content and calorie count, and what are some potential health benefits?

His mother never gave up on him and was determined to prove to the world that her child can be normal.

The coach often takes Cho-won's snack, and takes Cho-won to a jjimjilbang to relax. Even though Jung-wook slacks off most of the time, Cho-won's determination for running is firm (he accidentally runs 100 laps around a soccer field when the coach told him to without literally meaning it).He takes third place in a 10Â km running race, which causes his mother to set another goal for her son: to run a full marathon under three hours. This is not an easy task, however, as Cho-won wants to win but doesnât know how to pace himself. Therefore, his mother pleads the coach to run with Cho-won in order to teach him how to pace his running.

In particular, kudos to the quality of the sound reproduction, which I've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones.\nquestion: How bad is the sound?\nwhich I 've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones\n\nreview: The Prestige (2006)Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David BowieChristopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts.

The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

This would be similar to Shapley values where total prediction is decomposed into elements.\nHow can I achieve this preferably in Python or even SQL?\nI use formula ratio goods to ratio bads in my WOE formula such that a WOE of -3 would correspond to higher risk than on average.To convert your model predictions in logit form to scorecard points, you can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define your intercept and coefficients\nintercept = -3.15\ncoefficients = [-1.01, -1.00, -0.93]\n\n# Define your maximum scorecard points\nmax_points = 100\n\n# Define your logit function\ndef logit(x, intercept, coefficients):\n    return intercept + np.dot(coefficients, x)\n\n# Define your scorecard points function\ndef scorecard_points(logit_value, max_points):\n    return max_points -", "response": "To convert your model predictions in logit form to scorecard points, you can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define your intercept and coefficients\nintercept = -3.15\ncoefficients = [-1.01, -1.00, -0.93]\n\n# Define your maximum scorecard points\nmax_points = 100\n\n# Define your logit function\ndef logit(x, intercept, coefficients):\n    return intercept + np.dot(coefficients, x)\n\n# Define your scorecard points function\ndef scorecard_points(logit_value, max_points):\n    return max_points -", "elapsed": 36.226563453674316, "method": "./args/run_outs/all_wt_0_5_0"}, {"prompt": "Custom Domain Name Help Center Resolution#6444\nItem statusOpen\ndternyak opened 8 days ago\nDescription\n\ndternyak\n8 days ago\nNo description provided\n\nComments\n\ndternyak\n7 days ago\n@dtiesling Before we have Steve build out the designs, can you provide a rough spec of what forms/fields we'll need to enable our customers to point to our help center with a URL like help.acme.com\n\nWe'd basically need the same fields as https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains\ndternyak\n7 days ago (edited)\nAlso - can you confirm we'd be able to get this working with cloudflare reverse proxy?

W: Fifteen minutes! We may be late for the train. And with these heavy bags, too! I think we ought to take a taxi. M: Not at this hour. Look at the traffic. It's moving very slowly. We can get there just as quickly on foot. W: Well, I can't possibly carry this bag any farther. M: All right. Let me take it, then. W: Don't be silly. You can't carry two bags at the same time. M: Yes, I can. The bags aren't that heavy...hmm! W: You see! They're heavier than you thought! M: Perhaps it's not such a bad idea after all. W: What isn't such a bad idea? What do you mean? M: Taxi! Taxi!, Question: Where are the man and the woman going?\nAnswer:", "result": "In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question. You need to write an implausible answer to the question. Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\".\n\nLet me give you an example: M: I am considering dropping my dancing class. I am not making any progress. W: If I were you, I stick with it. It's definitely worth time and effort., Question: What does the man suggest the woman do?\nThe answer to this example can be: Take a more interesting class.\nHere is why: This is a good example. Based on the conversation, the man thinks the dancing class is worth time and effort. So, the man doesn't suggest her to take a more interesting class and one of the wrong answers is \"Take a more interesting class.\".\n\nOK. solve this:\nW: Why do we have to walk to the station? And where is it? M: It's just down that road...I think. W: Look! There's a policeman! Ask him the way. M: All right. I'll go and ask him. W: (pause for 6 seconds) So,what did he say?

Answer according to: Big shifts in trade and shipping trends are crashing together at the Port of Hong Kong. The city’s antitrust watchdog is investigating cartel allegations against the port’s biggest terminal operators, the WSJ’s Costas Paris and Joanne Chiu report, in a sign of how Hong Kong’s receding role in global shipping is creating conflicts on the docks. The antitrust investigation is over plans by the port’s top four terminal handlers to work together under an alliance that would operate berths controlling 95% of Hong Kong’s container volume. The operators aim to get more efficient, but the big goal is to reclaim container business that’s been lost to other fast-growing Asian gateways, particularly China’s big seaports. The new response at Hong Kong’s docks is creating a showdown between the terminal operators and cargo owners who say the strategy is simply a monopoly aimed at driving up costs for shippers.\nWarehouse developers simply can’t build fast enough to catch up with demand. The availability of industrial space fell to its lowest point since 2000 in the fourth quarter, the WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, and the gap between demand and supply grew wider in the second half of the year. Real-estate brokerage CBRE Group Inc. expects the imbalance that’s driven up the costs of warehousing in recent years will eventually turn around. But a market driven by the changing distribution patterns behind e-commerce shows few signs of cooling even in the seemingly late stages of a strong business cycle. That move toward equilibrium between supply and demand will likely take even longer in some of the country’s busiest distribution markets. CBRE says the availability rate in Los Angeles, nearby Orange County, Las Vegas, New York and eastern Pennsylvania remains far below the national average.\nA change in energy policies from Mexico’s new government is triggering disruption and shortages across the country’s oil supply chains.

At least 15 tankers were idling in the Gulf waiting to unload million barrels of gasoline in recent days, apparently the result of the president’s decision to shut down several key pipelines that carry the fuel inland from coastal terminals and refineries. The move is meant to combat fuel theft that cost state oil firm Pemex roughly $3 billion last year. It’s also exposed the fragile supply chains behind a commodity that is a major force in Mexico’s economy.\nA big supplier is raising high-stakes alarms over a struggling U.S. retailer. Pharmaceutical giant McKesson Corp. says regional retail chain Shopko is closing stores, stiffing suppliers and likely headed to bankruptcy, the WSJ’s Peg Brickley reports, in the latest example of tensions between suppliers and storeowners in a changing retail sector.

At the party, the two are called upon to sing karaoke together (\"Start of Something New\"). They find that they have a connection and decide to exchange numbers before going their separate ways. One week after Christmas break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom, and she explains that she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico and transferred to East High School over the break. Troy shows Gabriella around the school, and they pause in front of the sign-up sheet for the winter musical auditions. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) arrives, assuming that Gabriella is interested in auditioning. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl and has the scholastic decathlon captain, Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past academic achievements, which results in Taylor and Gabriella becoming great friends. During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing more than basketball (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform (\"What I've Been Looking For\"), but both are too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late.

At the party, the two are called upon to sing karaoke together (\"Start of Something New\"). They find that they have a connection and decide to exchange numbers before going their separate ways. One week after Christmas break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom, and she explains that she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico and transferred to East High School over the break. Troy shows Gabriella around the school, and they pause in front of the sign-up sheet for the winter musical auditions. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) arrives, assuming that Gabriella is interested in auditioning. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl and has the scholastic decathlon captain, Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past academic achievements, which results in Taylor and Gabriella becoming great friends. During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing more than basketball (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform (\"What I've Been Looking For\"), but both are too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late.
