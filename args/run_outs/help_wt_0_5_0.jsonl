After Battle of Berezina Napoleon succeeded to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.\n****\n[A]: army\n\ninput: Please answer the following: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what group is mentioned last? Context: Davis and his cabinet left the city by train that night, as government officials burned documents and departing Confederate troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny their contents to the victors. On April 2, 1865, General Godfrey Weitzel, commander of the 25th corps of the United States Colored Troops, accepted the city's surrender from the mayor and group of leading citizens who remained. The Union troops eventually managed to stop the raging fires but about 25% of the city's buildings were destroyed-\n++++++++++\noutput: The Union troops\n\nPlease answer this: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What are usually found in mainframe computers? Context: Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.\n++++++++\nAnswer: several CPUs\n\nQuestion: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was the main goal of the Ottomans? Context: The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous. The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact.\nAnswer:The main goal of the Ottomans was to consolidate and extend their power and to increase state revenues without damaging the prosperity of their subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of society intact. This was achieved through a combination of military conquest, administrative reforms, and economic policies that promoted trade and encouraged the growth of urban centers and commercial networks across the Ottoman Empire's vast territorial expanse. The ultimate aim was to create a prosperous and stable society that would support the expansion and consolidation of Ottoman power and maintain the traditional social order in the face of changing economic and political conditions in the Middle East and", "response": "The main goal of the Ottomans was to consolidate and extend their power and to increase state revenues without damaging the prosperity of their subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of society intact.

Your task is to \"decompose the question\"i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question.

ALL WONDERFUL. We had such a good time -- Roger and I sharing some of our adventures and sharing food with family and friends. So happy you enjoyed making the Romanian dishes... it made my day just knowing you tried the recipes:). Thank you so much for your feedback, I really appreciate it! It means a ton to me that you took the time to write... glad you stopped by:)! Dear Ellie!!! I´m so happy that I found your Blog…. On saturday I have invited the ambassador of Romania and his wife… Looking for Romanian recipes I found you!!!! I´m going to try several of your recipes!!! Anita, I am so happy you stopped by.:)! I can only hope that you find the recipes somewhat similar to your mom's cooking. I definitely can't promise it's close to your mom's recipes, because mom's cooking is always best... but maybe they can be a good starting point... and as you cook, you can easily adjust taste to your liking. Oh, Ana... my eyes watered when I read your kind email. Thank you for your kind words, they warmed my heart with thankfulness to the LORD for people like you. I really appreciate you stopping by and sharing. I am so glad God uses my blog to inspire and bring you memories of your growing up years in Romania. Was thrilled to hear that you made it to Montana! Montana is indeed a beautiful state... just these past several weeks I've been in awe with the changing colors... such a beautiful sight to behold... the red, orange, yellow and green leaves signaling that Fall has officially arrived. I never tire of the different seasonal changes here. May God continue to use your cooking talent to serve others. And as you said, HE gave us the cooking to be used for HIS glory. May you enjoy the rest of your vacation here in Montana... God bless your hands in the kitchen as you lovingly take care of your family. And you are always welcome here to read, try a recipe or two or just to reminisce about your beautiful time in Romania. I always love to hear from my readers:). Much love to you! I am in awe of the photos of Montana. I think you live in Paradise. I came to your site when I discovered the Japanese Milk Bread Recipe. I search for recipes on the Internet almost daily because I love to Cook/Bake and try new Recipes. I wanted to try it out your recipe because I have a Friend who has a Daughter-in-Law who is Japanese. My friend - is a Real Estate agent searching for a house for us. So when I saw the recipe for Japanese Milk Bread I sent him the Recipe because he loves everything Japanese after visiting there a few years ago. I am English born Canadian but lived in an Acadian Village for several years - Isn't t great how all our cultures and languages are coming together from your Recipe Site? I will be trying the Japanese Milk Bread soon. Your Love and Devotion to the Lord shines out in your words and recipes. How different from many other sites. And it is a reminder to me of how I have neglected the Lord in my life lately and how I need to focus on him with ALL MY HEART AND SOUL. Was it God who led me to your site to lead me back to him - I would say yes. It touched me so much. It was his unmistakable hand - a gentle reminder of what I can yet do for him in my life if I once again give it over to him. God bless you... and thanks so much for stopping by and taking the time to write such an encouraging comment! It was such a delight to hear from you.

Generate according to: Explora Cuisine, Interesant ca si mama mea a cumparat (mai de mult) un lasagna pan... tot de Paula Deen si ii place tare mult:). Anon, Multumesc mult de ajutorul pentru a face mititei mai buni:). Apreciez mult! Imi place tare idea sa fac mititei picanti. Si cred ca gretarul uns cu grasime de vaca face pentru un gust aparte! Nu am incercat sa pisez usturoiul cu sare, dar merita incercat, mai ales pentru cei care le plac mai mult usturoi:). Multumesc mult pentru sugestii si vizita. O zi placuta! My husband and I travelled in Romania in August 2013. For a special dinner party back home I tried some of Ellie's Romanian recipes -- Cozonac, Salata de Varza Rosie, Ostropel and Mititei. ALL WONDERFUL. We had such a good time -- Roger and I sharing some of our adventures and sharing food with family and friends. So happy you enjoyed making the Romanian dishes... it made my day just knowing you tried the recipes:). Thank you so much for your feedback, I really appreciate it! It means a ton to me that you took the time to write... glad you stopped by:)! Dear Ellie!!! I´m so happy that I found your Blog…. On saturday I have invited the ambassador of Romania and his wife… Looking for Romanian recipes I found you!!!! I´m going to try several of your recipes!!! Anita, I am so happy you stopped by.:)! I can only hope that you find the recipes somewhat similar to your mom's cooking. I definitely can't promise it's close to your mom's recipes, because mom's cooking is always best... but maybe they can be a good starting point... and as you cook, you can easily adjust taste to your liking. Oh, Ana... my eyes watered when I read your kind email. Thank you for your kind words, they warmed my heart with thankfulness to the LORD for people like you. I really appreciate you stopping by and sharing. I am so glad God uses my blog to inspire and bring you memories of your growing up years in Romania. Was thrilled to hear that you made it to Montana! Montana is indeed a beautiful state... just these past several weeks I've been in awe with the changing colors... such a beautiful sight to behold... the red, orange, yellow and green leaves signaling that Fall has officially arrived. I never tire of the different seasonal changes here. May God continue to use your cooking talent to serve others. And as you said, HE gave us the cooking to be used for HIS glory. May you enjoy the rest of your vacation here in Montana... God bless your hands in the kitchen as you lovingly take care of your family. And you are always welcome here to read, try a recipe or two or just to reminisce about your beautiful time in Romania. I always love to hear from my readers:). Much love to you! I am in awe of the photos of Montana. I think you live in Paradise. I came to your site when I discovered the Japanese Milk Bread Recipe. I search for recipes on the Internet almost daily because I love to Cook/Bake and try new Recipes. I wanted to try it out your recipe because I have a Friend who has a Daughter-in-Law who is Japanese. My friend - is a Real Estate agent searching for a house for us. So when I saw the recipe for Japanese Milk Bread I sent him the Recipe because he loves everything Japanese after visiting there a few years ago. I am English born Canadian but lived in an Acadian Village for several years - Isn't t great how all our cultures and languages are coming together from your Recipe Site? I will be trying the Japanese Milk Bread soon. Your Love and Devotion to the Lord shines out in your words and recipes. How different from many other sites. And it is a reminder to me of how I have neglected the Lord in my life lately and how I need to focus on him with ALL MY HEART AND SOUL. Was it God who led me to your site to lead me back to him - I would say yes. It touched me so much. It was his unmistakable hand - a gentle reminder of what I can yet do for him in my life if I once again give it over to him. God bless you... and thanks so much for stopping by and taking the time to write such an encouraging comment! It was such a delight to hear from you.

The tickets are $50.00 each. There is a 15% processing fee for the tickets. They are also charged $10.00 for parking and an additional $5.00 per person entrance fee. How much will it cost to go to the concert?\n\n\nLovely will sell 10 x 2 / 5 = 4 books for $2.50 each. She will sell 10 - 4 = 6 books for $2 each. Her earnings for the 4 books at $2.50 will be $2.50 x 4 = $10. Her earnings for the 6 books for $2 each will be $2 x 6 = $12. Thus, Lovely's total earning if all 10 books are sold is $10 + $12 = $22.\nThe answer: 22\nReverse engineering the question: A yearly book sale is held in school where students can sell their old books at a cheaper price. Two-fifths of Lovely's books can be sold for $2.50 each and the rest for $2 each. How much will Lovely earn if all 10 books were sold?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: By the first two months, 20 / 100 * 200 = 40 mountains had erupted.

When 40% of the remaining mountains exploded, the number of mountains that were still intact decreased by 40 / 100 * 160 = 64. The number of mountains that hadn't exploded after the second explosions is 160 - 64 = 96. When 50% of the mountains which were still intact exploded, the number of mountains that hadn't erupted was reduced by 50 / 100 * 96 = 48. At the end of the year, 96 - 48 = 48 mountains remained intact and hadn't exploded.\nThe answer: 48\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: A mountain range has 200 active volcanoes.

The latest estimates represent those with payments due on Oct. 1, 1999, who defaulted sometime before Sept. 30, 2001.\nWhile the federal government administers loans, colleges and universities bear much of the legal responsibility for counseling students on how to manage their debt.

As the Danes gird their loins and take up arms, the creature enters.It's huge, about 15 feet tall and vaguely humanoid in appearance, but clearly not all human. Its misshapen, deformed, and appears to have, instead of ears, some highly sensitive pads that serve as hearing organs. The screaming of the Danes seems to hurt the creatures ears and, enraged, he begins to tear the revelers apart, literally.Eventually, the creature makes his way to Hrothgar, who, to his credit, didn't run away in a drunken panic, but held his ground. The King demands that the monster fight him, but the creature is unafraid. It simply takes a long almost quizzical look at Hrothgar and abruptly withdraws.Back at his cave, the monster is chastised by his mother for killing men.

That may not come across visually, since on the surface it's just a standard Camaro ZL1 with decals. But underneath is an LT4 V8 tuned to 1,000 horsepower and 966 lb-ft of torque.\nTo hit those lofty outputs, Hennessey ditched the standard supercharger for a bigger one and added an upgraded intercooler. The company also fitted a more aggressive camshaft, ported heads, long-tube headers, and tuned the ECU. Coupled with drag tires, Hennessey claims the Exorcist is good for a 0-60 mph time of under 3 seconds and a quarter-mile time of under 10 seconds. And Hennessey will sell you a set of drag radials to help you achieve those times, but like the rest of the package it'll cost you.\nThe complete package, including the Exorcist decals, rings in at $55,000 – and that's on top of the Camaro ZL1 you have to supply. Unless you already have one or picked up a used or discounted example, the least you'll pay for an Exorcist is just over $118,000. And if you want Hennessey to upgrade an automatic, you'll be spending another $9,950 to upgrade the transmission. On the plus side, the Exorcist upgrade does come with a 2 year/24,000 mile warranty.

Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.  This is indie rock at it's finest.  The production takes this album up to new great heights.  This album is similar to The Forbidden Love EP, which is also good.  In my opinion, We Have The Facts, and The Photo Album demonstrate Death Cab's early raw style, where everything was understated simply and beautifully, before the overproduced Transatlanticism and Plans.  This is a great album to listen to if you want to relax, or just think.  As they continue to develop as artists, it's amazing to watch their sound change, for better or for worse.

As you will rapidly discover, there are missing entries,\nand, candidly, some responses from the population are outright lies. Part of the grading for the assignment will\nassess these details.\nThe town from the census is a modestly sized one sandwiched between two much larger cities that it\nis connected to by motorways. The town does not have a university, but students do live in the town and\ncommute to the nearby cities. Once you have a cleaned dataset to analyse, your task is to decide the following:\n(a) What should be built on an unoccupied plot of land that the local government wishes to\ndevelop? Your choices are:\n(i) High-density housing. This should be built if the population is significantly expanding.\n(ii) Low-density housing. This should be built if the population is “affluent” and there is\ndemand for large family housing.\n(iii) Train station. There are potentially a lot of commuters in the town and building a train\nstation could take pressure off the roads. But how will you identify commuters?\n(iv) Religious building. There is already one place of worship for Catholics in the town. Is\nthere demand for a second Church (if so, which denomination?), or for a different religious building?\n(v) Emergency medical building. Not a full hospital, but a minor injuries centre. This should\nbe built if there are many injuries or future pregnancies likely in the population.\n(vi) Something else?\nWhichever you choose, you must justify it from the data provided to you and argue it is a priority\nagainst other choices.\nThe following is the dataset:\nHouse Number,Street,First Name,Surname,Age,Relationship to Head of House,Marital Status,Gender,Occupation,Infirmity,Religion\n1,Kaur Drive,Douglas,Adams,77,Head,Widowed,Male,Retired Museum education officer,None,Christian\n2,Kaur Drive,Hollie,West,79,Head,Single,Female,Retired Dealer,None,Christian\n3,Kaur Drive,Joseph,Hall,55,Head,Single,Male,Fast food restaurant manager,None,Christian\n4,Kaur Drive,Gregory,Cox,35,Head,Single,Male,Housing manager/officer,None,None\n5,Kaur Drive,Lydia,Jones,42,Head,Single,Female,Unemployed,None,Catholic\n5,Kaur Drive,Francis,Jones,3,Son,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n6,Kaur Drive,Diana,Martin,80,Head,Widowed,Female,Retired Accounting technician,None,Christian\n6,Kaur Drive,Ruth,Godfrey,12,Granddaughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n7,Kaur Drive,Glenn,Turner,76,Head,Widowed,Male,\"Retired Designer, textile\",None,None\n8,Kaur Drive,Suzanne,Jones,46,Head,Single,Female,\"Therapist, occupational\",None,None\n9,Kaur Drive,Kayleigh,Dean,27,Head,Single,Female,Immunologist,None,None\n9,Kaur Drive,Samantha,Sheppard-Dean,2,Daughter,NA,Female,Child,None,NA\n10,Kaur Drive,Ellie,Hyde,54,Head,Widowed,Female,Occupational hygienist,None,Methodist\n11,Kaur Drive,Mohammad,Wilkinson,35,Head,Single,Male,Careers adviser,None,Methodist\n11,Kaur Drive,Billy,Wilkinson,3,Son,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n11,Kaur Drive,Mathew,Wilkinson,1,Son,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n12,Kaur Drive,Melanie,Stewart,70,Head,Married,Female,Retired Radio broadcast assistant,Disabled,Christian\n12,Kaur Drive,Brian,Stewart,72,Husband,Married,Male,\"Retired Radiographer, diagnostic\",None,None\n13,Kaur Drive,Sarah,Robertson,34,Head,Single,Female,Unemployed,None,Muslim\n13,Kaur Drive,Shannon,Robertson,12,Daughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n14,Kaur Drive,Conor,Akhtar,68,Head,Single,Male,Retired Translator,None,None\n15,Kaur Drive,Fiona,Walker,35,Head,Single,Female,\"Scientist, clinical (histocompatibility and immunogenetics)\",None,Christian\n16,Kaur Drive,Kirsty,Davies,40,Head,Divorced,Female,\"Psychologist, prison and probation services\",None,Methodist\n1,Lime Road,Adam,Hayes,37,Head,Divorced,Male,Advice worker,None,None\n2,Lime Road,Hugh,Roberts,80,Head,Divorced,Male,\"Retired Radiographer, therapeutic\",None,Christian\n3,Lime Road,Scott,Ali-Morris,48,Head,Married,Male,Hydrogeologist,None,Christian\n3,Lime Road,Maureen,Ali-Morris,38,Wife,Married,Female,Research scientist (maths),None,Christian\n3,Lime Road,Dylan,Ali-Morris,8,Son,NA,Male,Student,None,NA\n4,Lime Road,Jonathan,Lewis,75,Head,Widowed,Male,\"Retired Surveyor, insurance\",None,None\n5,Lime Road,Donald,Saunders,67,Head,Widowed,Male,Market researcher,None,Christian\n6,Lime Road,Joel,Ahmed,89,Head,Married,Male,\"Retired Nurse, learning disability\",None,Christian\n6,Lime Road,Claire,Ahmed,88,Wife,Married,Female,Retired Marketing executive,None,Christian\n7,Lime Road,Michelle,Jones,64,Head,Divorced,Female,\"Production designer, theatre/television/film\",None,Christian\n7,Lime Road,Stephen,Jones,0,Grandson,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n8,Lime Road,Garry,Browne,49,Head,Single,Male,Unemployed,None,None\n9,Lime Road,Kimberley,Kaur,22,Head,Divorced,Female,University Student,None,None\n10,Lime Road,Nicole,Davies,35,Head,Married,Female,Unemployed,None,Catholic\n10,Lime Road,Hugh,Davies,37,Husband,Married,Male,\"Buyer, retail\",None,Catholic\n10,Lime Road,Kirsty,Davies,8,Daughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n11,Lime Road,Dorothy,Chapman,59,Head,Single,Female,\"Production designer, theatre/television/film\",None,None\n12,Lime Road,Amanda,Barnes,36,Head,Single,Female,Surgeon,None,Christian\n13,Lime Road,Amelia,Parkin,44,Head,Single,Female,Unemployed,None,None\n14,Lime Road,Sarah,Taylor,60,Head,Divorced,Female,Unemployed,None,None\n14,Lime Road,Annette,Taylor,11,Granddaughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n15,Lime Road,Valerie,James,23,Head,Divorced,Female,Podiatrist,None,None\n16,Lime Road,June,Saunders,68,Head,Widowed,Female,\"Retired Surveyor, building control\",None,ChristianBased on the given mock census dataset, there are several factors to consider when deciding what should be built on the unoccupied plot of land that the local government wishes to develop.

Here are some English ones for your enjoyment. Have Your Heart in Your Mouth This expression means that you're really afraid or anxious about something. When your heart starts beating so much that you can feel a thumping  in your throat, it may feel like you \"have your heart in your mouth\". Have Butterflies in the Stomach How did butterflies get in your stomach? Well, those really aren't butterflies in there. It is a way of describing those nervous feelings you might get before a test or a very important decision. These stomach flutters   are normal and happen to many people. Some people believe having a few butterflies might even help you perform better. Sick as a Dog If you've ever been very sick, you may have used this expression. Because dogs eat just about anything they find, they often get sick. So it's all right to describe someone who's not feeling well as being \"sick as a dog\" . Under the Weather When it's rainy all day outside, how would you feel? This expression comes from the idea that bad weather might hurt a person's health and mood .

Article: Americans have used colors to create many expressions they use every day. We say you're 'in the pink' when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good. The color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'. Some people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful (  ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the 'black' expressions have bad meaning. A company 'in the red' is losing money. If someone tells you to put someone 'in black and white', they want you to write it down. Question: I was really   _   when I saw his nice new car.

A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. The data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor MRI provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.\nOutput: Microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.\nThis title is appropriate for the given abstract because the focus of this abstract is cerebral white matter assesment.\n\nNew input case for you: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that results from cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells. In T1DM animal models, it has been shown that the systemic administration of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, also referred as to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), results in the regeneration of pancreatic islets. Mechanisms underlying this effect are still poorly understood. Our aims were to assess whether donor MSCs (a) differentiate into pancreatic β-cells and (b) modify systemic and pancreatic pathophysiologic markers of T1DM. After the intravenous administration of 5 × 10(5) syngeneic MSCs, we observed that mice with T1DM reverted their hyperglycemia and presented no donor-derived insulin-producing cells. In contrast, 7 and 65 days post-transplantation, MSCs were engrafted into secondary lymphoid organs. This correlated with a systemic and local reduction in the abundance of autoaggressive T cells together with an increase in regulatory T cells. Additionally, in the pancreas of mice with T1DM treated with MSCs, we observed a cytokine profile shift from proinflammatory to antinflammatory. MSC transplantation did not reduce pancreatic cell apoptosis but recovered local expression and increased the circulating levels of epidermal growth factor, a pancreatic trophic factor. Therefore, the antidiabetic effect of MSCs intravenously administered is unrelated to their transdifferentiation potential but to their capability to restore the balance between Th1 and Th2 immunological responses along with the modification of the pancreatic microenvironment. Our data should be taken into account when designing clinical trials aimed to evaluate MSC transplantation in patients with T1DM since the presence of endogenous precursors seems to be critical in order to restore glycemic control.\nOutput:", "result": "Given the task definition, example input & output, solve the new input case.\nIn this task, you are given an abstract of article.
