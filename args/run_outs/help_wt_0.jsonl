Question: What is another word for average? Context: The problem of the direction of time arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is not time-reversal invariant. Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future.\nAnswer: directly\n\n[Q]: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

However, an important limitation is the requirement for lumbar puncture. For this reason, a sensitive and reliable blood biomarker of CNS injury would represent a welcome advance in both clinical and research settings.', 'To explore whether plasma concentrations of NFL might be used to detect CNS injury in HIV infection, an ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay was developed. Using a cross-sectional design, we measured NFL in paired CSF and plasma samples from 121 HIV-infected subjects divided into groups according to stage of their systemic disease, presence of overt HIV-associated dementia (HAD), and after antiretroviral treatment (ART)-induced viral suppression. HIV-negative controls were also examined.', 'Plasma and CSF NFL concentrations were very highly correlated (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). While NFL was more than 50-fold lower plasma than CSF it was within the quantifiable range of the new plasma assay in all subjects, including the HIV negatives and the HIV positives with normal CSF NFL concentrations. The pattern of NFL changes were almost identical in plasma and CSF, both exhibiting similar age-related increases in concentrations along with highest values in HAD and substantial elevations in ART-naïve neuroasymptomatic subjects with low blood CD4(+) T cells.\n[EX A]: 0\n\n[EX Q]: Although right-sided diverticulitis is perceived to have a higher incidence among Asians and infrequently requires surgical management in comparison with sigmoid diverticulitis, it is unknown whether differences in outcomes are due to ethnic disparity or disease pathophysiology.', 'The aim of this study was to determine the surgical outcomes for Asian and non-Asian patients with diverticulitis who underwent colectomy.', 'Patients identifiable by ethnicity in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample with diverticulitis and colectomy between 2004 and 2010 were included. Univariate comparisons were made between Asian and non-Asian patients by using t tests for continuous variables and χ tests for categorical variables. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to compare Asian patients with otherwise similar non-Asian patients.', 'Included were 58,142 non-Asian and 335 Asian patients with diverticulitis who underwent a colectomy.', 'The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, and total costs.', 'Asian patients were younger (56.1 vs. 59.2 years, p < 0.0001), were more likely to undergo a right colectomy (22.7% vs. 4.1%, p < 0.0001), and were more likely to have emergent/urgent surgery than the non-Asian patients (67.1% vs. 49.8%, p < 0.0001). Without controlling for patient/disease factors, there were statistically significant differences in mortality (non-Asian 2.2% vs. Asian 4.2%; p = 0.014), length of stay (non-Asian 8.9 vs. Asian 9.8 days; p = 0.0166), and costs (non-Asian $18,783 vs. Asian $21,901; p = 0.001).

Survival analysis for 109 patients with post-chemotherapy effusions showed significant association between Wee1 expression and poor overall survival (p=0.004), a finding which retained its independent prognostic role in Cox multivariate analysis (p=0.003).\n[EX A]: 1\n\n[EX Q]: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain protein (NFL) is a sensitive marker of neuronal injury in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including the CNS dysfunction injury that is common in untreated HIV infection. However, an important limitation is the requirement for lumbar puncture. For this reason, a sensitive and reliable blood biomarker of CNS injury would represent a welcome advance in both clinical and research settings.', 'To explore whether plasma concentrations of NFL might be used to detect CNS injury in HIV infection, an ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay was developed. Using a cross-sectional design, we measured NFL in paired CSF and plasma samples from 121 HIV-infected subjects divided into groups according to stage of their systemic disease, presence of overt HIV-associated dementia (HAD), and after antiretroviral treatment (ART)-induced viral suppression. HIV-negative controls were also examined.', 'Plasma and CSF NFL concentrations were very highly correlated (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). While NFL was more than 50-fold lower plasma than CSF it was within the quantifiable range of the new plasma assay in all subjects, including the HIV negatives and the HIV positives with normal CSF NFL concentrations. The pattern of NFL changes were almost identical in plasma and CSF, both exhibiting similar age-related increases in concentrations along with highest values in HAD and substantial elevations in ART-naïve neuroasymptomatic subjects with low blood CD4(+) T cells.\n[EX A]: 0\n\n[EX Q]: Although right-sided diverticulitis is perceived to have a higher incidence among Asians and infrequently requires surgical management in comparison with sigmoid diverticulitis, it is unknown whether differences in outcomes are due to ethnic disparity or disease pathophysiology.', 'The aim of this study was to determine the surgical outcomes for Asian and non-Asian patients with diverticulitis who underwent colectomy.', 'Patients identifiable by ethnicity in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample with diverticulitis and colectomy between 2004 and 2010 were included. Univariate comparisons were made between Asian and non-Asian patients by using t tests for continuous variables and χ tests for categorical variables. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to compare Asian patients with otherwise similar non-Asian patients.', 'Included were 58,142 non-Asian and 335 Asian patients with diverticulitis who underwent a colectomy.', 'The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, and total costs.', 'Asian patients were younger (56.1 vs. 59.2 years, p < 0.0001), were more likely to undergo a right colectomy (22.7% vs. 4.1%, p < 0.0001), and were more likely to have emergent/urgent surgery than the non-Asian patients (67.1% vs. 49.8%, p < 0.0001). Without controlling for patient/disease factors, there were statistically significant differences in mortality (non-Asian 2.2% vs. Asian 4.2%; p = 0.014), length of stay (non-Asian 8.9 vs. Asian 9.8 days; p = 0.0166), and costs (non-Asian $18,783 vs. Asian $21,901; p = 0.001). Propensity score matching comparing 333 non-Asian patients with 333 similar Asian patients showed that, whereas differences in cost and length of stay became insignificant, the difference in mortality remained statistically significant.\n[EX A]:1", "response": "1", "elapsed": 124.67708468437195, "method": "./args/run_outs/help_wt_0"}, {"prompt": "Please answer the following question: My love affair with technology began at an early age.

So happy you enjoyed making the Romanian dishes... it made my day just knowing you tried the recipes:). Thank you so much for your feedback, I really appreciate it! It means a ton to me that you took the time to write... glad you stopped by:)! Dear Ellie!!! I´m so happy that I found your Blog…. On saturday I have invited the ambassador of Romania and his wife… Looking for Romanian recipes I found you!!!! I´m going to try several of your recipes!!! Anita, I am so happy you stopped by.:)! I can only hope that you find the recipes somewhat similar to your mom's cooking. I definitely can't promise it's close to your mom's recipes, because mom's cooking is always best... but maybe they can be a good starting point... and as you cook, you can easily adjust taste to your liking. Oh, Ana... my eyes watered when I read your kind email. Thank you for your kind words, they warmed my heart with thankfulness to the LORD for people like you. I really appreciate you stopping by and sharing. I am so glad God uses my blog to inspire and bring you memories of your growing up years in Romania. Was thrilled to hear that you made it to Montana! Montana is indeed a beautiful state... just these past several weeks I've been in awe with the changing colors... such a beautiful sight to behold... the red, orange, yellow and green leaves signaling that Fall has officially arrived. I never tire of the different seasonal changes here. May God continue to use your cooking talent to serve others. And as you said, HE gave us the cooking to be used for HIS glory. May you enjoy the rest of your vacation here in Montana... God bless your hands in the kitchen as you lovingly take care of your family. And you are always welcome here to read, try a recipe or two or just to reminisce about your beautiful time in Romania. I always love to hear from my readers:). Much love to you! I am in awe of the photos of Montana. I think you live in Paradise. I came to your site when I discovered the Japanese Milk Bread Recipe. I search for recipes on the Internet almost daily because I love to Cook/Bake and try new Recipes. I wanted to try it out your recipe because I have a Friend who has a Daughter-in-Law who is Japanese. My friend - is a Real Estate agent searching for a house for us. So when I saw the recipe for Japanese Milk Bread I sent him the Recipe because he loves everything Japanese after visiting there a few years ago. I am English born Canadian but lived in an Acadian Village for several years - Isn't t great how all our cultures and languages are coming together from your Recipe Site? I will be trying the Japanese Milk Bread soon. Your Love and Devotion to the Lord shines out in your words and recipes. How different from many other sites. And it is a reminder to me of how I have neglected the Lord in my life lately and how I need to focus on him with ALL MY HEART AND SOUL. Was it God who led me to your site to lead me back to him - I would say yes. It touched me so much. It was his unmistakable hand - a gentle reminder of what I can yet do for him in my life if I once again give it over to him. God bless you... and thanks so much for stopping by and taking the time to write such an encouraging comment! It was such a delight to hear from you. I was simply touched with your comment, and I know the Lord used you to strengthen my faith in Him. He is ever so kind to let us know how He sometimes uses us in ways unbeknownst to us. I am grateful to know that the blog has been of help to you, not only in searching for recipes, but as a reminder to draw nearer to the Lord God(which is of eternal importance).

Good luck!\nInput:\n```\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    sum = 0\n    while (n != 0):\n        sum += n % 10\n        n = n // 10\n    return sum\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if (n == 0):\n        return 0\n    elif (n == 1):\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\nsum = 0\nfor i in range(1, 101):\n    sum += sum_of_digits(fibonacci(i))\nprint(sum)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n?????????\n```The sum of all the digits in the first 100 Fibonacci numbers is 1,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001", "response": "The sum of all the digits in the first 100 Fibonacci numbers is 1,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001", "elapsed": 30.557196378707886, "method": "./args/run_outs/help_wt_0"}, {"prompt": "What are some advantages of studying a second language?

Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.

Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.  This is indie rock at it's finest.  The production takes this album up to new great heights.  This album is similar to The Forbidden Love EP, which is also good.

Article: Expressions cover all parts of our life. They may be around your ears every day. You may know a lot of Chinese expressions that describe how you feel. Here are some English ones for your enjoyment. Have Your Heart in Your Mouth This expression means that you're really afraid or anxious about something. When your heart starts beating so much that you can feel a thumping  in your throat, it may feel like you \"have your heart in your mouth\". Have Butterflies in the Stomach How did butterflies get in your stomach? Well, those really aren't butterflies in there. It is a way of describing those nervous feelings you might get before a test or a very important decision. These stomach flutters   are normal and happen to many people. Some people believe having a few butterflies might even help you perform better. Sick as a Dog If you've ever been very sick, you may have used this expression. Because dogs eat just about anything they find, they often get sick. So it's all right to describe someone who's not feeling well as being \"sick as a dog\" . Under the Weather When it's rainy all day outside, how would you feel? This expression comes from the idea that bad weather might hurt a person's health and mood . Question: When somebody says \" under the weather\" , he must feel   _   . Answer:\n****\nA: upset\n\n\nProblem:OPTIONS:\n- red\n- blue\n- green\n- black\n\nRead the following article and answer the question. Article: Americans have used colors to create many expressions they use every day. We say you're 'in the pink' when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good. The color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'. Some people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful (  ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the 'black' expressions have bad meaning. A company 'in the red' is losing money. If someone tells you to put someone 'in black and white', they want you to write it down. Question: I was really   _   when I saw his nice new car.

It is a way of describing those nervous feelings you might get before a test or a very important decision. These stomach flutters   are normal and happen to many people. Some people believe having a few butterflies might even help you perform better. Sick as a Dog If you've ever been very sick, you may have used this expression. Because dogs eat just about anything they find, they often get sick. So it's all right to describe someone who's not feeling well as being \"sick as a dog\" . Under the Weather When it's rainy all day outside, how would you feel? This expression comes from the idea that bad weather might hurt a person's health and mood . Question: When somebody says \" under the weather\" , he must feel   _   . Answer:\n****\nA: upset\n\n\nProblem:OPTIONS:\n- red\n- blue\n- green\n- black\n\nRead the following article and answer the question. Article: Americans have used colors to create many expressions they use every day. We say you're 'in the pink' when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good. The color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'. Some people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful (  ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the 'black' expressions have bad meaning. A company 'in the red' is losing money. If someone tells you to put someone 'in black and white', they want you to write it down. Question: I was really   _   when I saw his nice new car.

Article: An English traveler found himself in a northern European country with a little money to buy the ticket for the travel back home. As he knew that it would take him only two days to get to England, he thought that he would be all right without food. So he bought a ticket and went on board. He closed his ears to the lunch bell. When dinner time came, he refused to go to the dining hall, saying that he was not feeling well. The next morning, he didn't go to breakfast and at lunch time he again stayed in his room. At dinner time he was so hungry that he could not stand it any longer. \"I'm going to eat, \" he said, \"even if they throw me into the sea. \" At dinner he ate everything in front of him at the table, then he worried about the coming trouble. \"Bring me the bill,\" he said. \"there isn't any bill. \" Was the answer. \"On the ship the money for the ticket includes meals. \" The traveler regretted when he heard this. .

Carlock was an on-again, off-again girlfriend to Love, said Sheppard. \n\nAccording to testimony, Carlock and Eric Reginald Robinson then drove from Love's house to San Diego with a backpack, containing three pipe bombs. Carlock detonated the bombs at the front doors of the courthouse, prosecutors said. \n\nCarlock, Sanders and Robinson were charged and each previously pleaded guilty for their parts in the plan. \n\nAt the time of the bombing, Love was in \"dire financial straits,\" prosecutors said, and faced jail time stemming from two pending criminal cases. \n\n\"The evidence showed that he directed the May 4, 2008, bombing for the purpose of obtaining reward money and a break on his state charges by providing information about the bombing to law enforcement,\" prosecutors said in a statement. \n[A]: Who was found guilty of 10 charges?\n\n\n[Q]: (CNN)Prison life won't be pretty for Aaron Hernandez, the former NFL player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole. \n\nAfter correction officers evaluate him, he will be shipped to Massachusetts' flagship maximum-security prison, one of the most high-tech jails in the United States with no history of breakouts: the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, about 40 miles outside downtown Boston. \n\nIt's called Souza, for short, and it's the state's newest prison, opened in 1998, with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire. \n\n\"I don't know the date, but he'll be going there.

A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization.

In T1DM animal models, it has been shown that the systemic administration of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, also referred as to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), results in the regeneration of pancreatic islets. Mechanisms underlying this effect are still poorly understood. Our aims were to assess whether donor MSCs (a) differentiate into pancreatic β-cells and (b) modify systemic and pancreatic pathophysiologic markers of T1DM. After the intravenous administration of 5 × 10(5) syngeneic MSCs, we observed that mice with T1DM reverted their hyperglycemia and presented no donor-derived insulin-producing cells. In contrast, 7 and 65 days post-transplantation, MSCs were engrafted into secondary lymphoid organs. This correlated with a systemic and local reduction in the abundance of autoaggressive T cells together with an increase in regulatory T cells. Additionally, in the pancreas of mice with T1DM treated with MSCs, we observed a cytokine profile shift from proinflammatory to antinflammatory. MSC transplantation did not reduce pancreatic cell apoptosis but recovered local expression and increased the circulating levels of epidermal growth factor, a pancreatic trophic factor. Therefore, the antidiabetic effect of MSCs intravenously administered is unrelated to their transdifferentiation potential but to their capability to restore the balance between Th1 and Th2 immunological responses along with the modification of the pancreatic microenvironment. Our data should be taken into account when designing clinical trials aimed to evaluate MSC transplantation in patients with T1DM since the presence of endogenous precursors seems to be critical in order to restore glycemic control.\nOutput:", "result": "Given the task definition, example input & output, solve the new input case.\nIn this task, you are given an abstract of article.
