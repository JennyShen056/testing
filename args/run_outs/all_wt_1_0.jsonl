[{"prompt": "How does spaghetti squash compare to traditional pasta in terms of nutritional content and calorie count, and what are some potential health benefits? Generate according to: Golden yellow and oval shaped, spaghetti squash usually weighs about 4 to 8 pounds. When cooked, the inside looks just like spaghetti and can be prepared in the same way. A great way to get your veggies, spaghetti squash is rich in nutrients including potassium, vitamin A, beta carotene and folic acid and can be substituted for spaghetti in any pasta dish. It's lower in calories than pasta and not nearly as heavy so you don't feel like you've eaten too much afterwards as sometimes happens with pasta. Spaghetti squash can be served as a main course with marinara sauce and meatballs, just as you would serve spaghetti (pasta). Or, make it a side vegetable with roast beef, pork or fish. Toss it with butter for a simple side or add your own mixture of herbs and spices. It also adds a nice texture and color to any salad. When selecting a squash look for a pale yellow color with no bruises or soft spots. Avoid the ones that still have some green skin as they would not have matured yet. Spaghetti squash can be baked, boiled, steamed or microwaved. The skin of an uncooked squash is thick and tough making it difficult to peel (practically impossible) or cut with a knife. I find it's easiest to bake it whole. Using a fork remove the spaghetti strands, they separate easily. Serve your spaghetti squash in any of these colorful dishes. A touch of Italy or beautiful Mexico inspired bright tones. Keep it simple with images of vegetables and herbs. Use them for soup, cereal, salad...anything at all! These Pyrex baking dishes are just what you'll need for spaghetti squash. They can go in the oven, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and microwave. Use them for baking cakes, lasagna, casseroles and lots more. It's lighter than pasta but can be served with the same sauces you would use for spaghetti. Spaghetti squash salad is a great idea! I'll experiment with that. I drink water with meals, but I suppose white or red wine would be nice depending on the sauce. candy47, Do you have any spaghetti squash salad recipes? What do you serve for drinks with your fresh and heated versions? I'm glad you had a pleasant memory Brenda marie. Yes MBC, healthier and lighter than pasta. You don't feel 'heavy' after eating spaghetti squash. I love spaghetti Squash! And it's healthier than pasta. I've had spaghetti squash a few times - it's definitely a vegetable version of spaghetti! Happy that this article reminded me it's in season again right now.

Article: In Germany, English expressions are used in conversations and increasingly in written form. Advertisements are often expressed completely in English. When I go to the gym, there are \"aerobic-classes  \". We \"warm up\". We go \"jogging.\" In business, we attend a \"meeting\" and we have \"good connections.\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \"Americanization\". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich  , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice.

Article: In Germany, English expressions are used in conversations and increasingly in written form. Advertisements are often expressed completely in English. When I go to the gym, there are \"aerobic-classes  \". We \"warm up\". We go \"jogging.\" In business, we attend a \"meeting\" and we have \"good connections.\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \"Americanization\". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich  , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice.

In particular, kudos to the quality of the sound reproduction, which I've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones.\nquestion: How bad is the sound?\nwhich I 've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones\n\nreview: The Prestige (2006)Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David BowieChristopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.\nquestion: What was an impeccable act?\nBale 's performance is superb and I think it 's the best of his career Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless .

In particular, kudos to the quality of the sound reproduction, which I've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones.\nquestion: How bad is the sound?\nwhich I 've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones\n\nreview: The Prestige (2006)Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David BowieChristopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.\nquestion: What was an impeccable act?\nBale 's performance is superb and I think it 's the best of his career Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless .

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by.

I'm assuming it was probably gonna be about how I've been talking to him the past few weeks or something.\n\nAITA for not wanting to talk to this guy even though I feel like I've clearly expressed that fact?\nSolution:", "result": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation. The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \"RIGHT\" or \"WRONG\".\nOne example: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.\n\nM wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. \n\nM proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying \"of course you dont know, because you never look.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?\nSolution is here: RIGHT\nExplanation: the author requests is justified.\n\nNow, solve this: So I have English class my first period of the day and I REALLY don't feel like talking to anyone that early in the morning (7:00am), but there's this guy that sits nearby me that just repeatedly tries to make conversation with me. I'm usually wearing headphones so I can avoid him talking to me, but he always just taps on my desk so I can help him with something (look at his essay, help him understand an assignment, etc.). I usually just respond to him very dry and with as little words as possible, put my headphones back in and do my work. \n\nThis has been going on for weeks now and the guy STILL  won't stop talking to me.

We know the market has a lot of noise, and we need to stand out. Our Buyers are always technical and are more impressed by numbers and not with sales jargon.\n\nYou know that Turbit monitors 1700 Wind turbines and has 3500+ neural networks in production. We send 1000 Alarms per week and set ca. 250 labels with a false positive rate of 10%.\n\nCustomers are excited about Turbit and scaling their entire fleet: \nhttps://www.vsb.energy/de/de/newsroom/presse/presse-detail/vsb-service-setzt-auf-kuenstliche-intelligenz-von-turbit/\n\nIn general, our customers like Turbit for the precision and traceability of its analysis. For Every alarm we send, we share an automatic analysis of the alarm and benchmark this abnormally behaving turbine with its neighbors. \nIn our regular customer success meetings, we prepare the events and walk our Customers through the most important ones. Our Customers then engage with their Service Partners to address the issues in the field. \n\nIn addition, we work with EnergieKOntor AG, Encavis AG, Prokon, EnergieTeam, and Neon.\n\nTurbit uses historical SCADA data to learn the expected behavior of each component and the entire wind turbine. When there is insufficient data, we use transfer learning and build the training data set with a similarity score from our database. \n\nIn addition, we have a strict retraining schedule to improve monitoring precision. For example, when we have a confirmed alarm, we exclude this time frame for future training since it is not representing normal operation behavior. \nSo far, Turbit has successfully detected more than 35 different failure types.\nWe label our alarms in our customer success meetings; we have more than 3000 labeled alarms in our failure database and train neural networks to predict the root cause and relevance of the alarms when we send them out.

Your task is to engage with Head of Asset Managers of Companys owning and operating wind turbines on LinkedIn or via cold E-Mail. \nAt Turbit, we have a strict policy to be brief, upfront, technical, honest, and demonstrate relevance and value to our clients. We know the market has a lot of noise, and we need to stand out. Our Buyers are always technical and are more impressed by numbers and not with sales jargon.\n\nYou know that Turbit monitors 1700 Wind turbines and has 3500+ neural networks in production. We send 1000 Alarms per week and set ca. 250 labels with a false positive rate of 10%.\n\nCustomers are excited about Turbit and scaling their entire fleet: \nhttps://www.vsb.energy/de/de/newsroom/presse/presse-detail/vsb-service-setzt-auf-kuenstliche-intelligenz-von-turbit/\n\nIn general, our customers like Turbit for the precision and traceability of its analysis. For Every alarm we send, we share an automatic analysis of the alarm and benchmark this abnormally behaving turbine with its neighbors. \nIn our regular customer success meetings, we prepare the events and walk our Customers through the most important ones. Our Customers then engage with their Service Partners to address the issues in the field. \n\nIn addition, we work with EnergieKOntor AG, Encavis AG, Prokon, EnergieTeam, and Neon.\n\nTurbit uses historical SCADA data to learn the expected behavior of each component and the entire wind turbine. When there is insufficient data, we use transfer learning and build the training data set with a similarity score from our database. \n\nIn addition, we have a strict retraining schedule to improve monitoring precision. For example, when we have a confirmed alarm, we exclude this time frame for future training since it is not representing normal operation behavior. \nSo far, Turbit has successfully detected more than 35 different failure types.\nWe label our alarms in our customer success meetings; we have more than 3000 labeled alarms in our failure database and train neural networks to predict the root cause and relevance of the alarms when we send them out. In addition Turbit works on the prediction of solutions and the value of the alarm as well. \n\nThe biggest value proposition is that Service teams act on Turbit Analysis.

A valid code must be a semiprime number that is not a perfect square.\n\nHere", "elapsed": 23.10181999206543, "method": "./args/run_outs/all_wt_1_0"}, {"prompt": "What is the most efficient way to perform a binary search on a large dataset of strings in C++?
