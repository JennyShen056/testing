Solve this instance: Paragraph: Recent epidemics of West Nile virus (WNV) around the world have been associated with significant rates of mortality and morbidity in humans. To develop standard WNV diagnostic tools that can differentiate WNV from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to WNV envelope (E) protein were produced and characterized by isotyping, reactivity with denatured and native antigens, affinity assay, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and epitope competition, as well as cross-reactivity with JEV. Two of the MAbs (6A11 and 4B3) showed stronger reactivity with E protein than the others (2F5 and 6H7) in Western blot analysis. 4B3 could bind with denatured antigen, as well as native antigens in indirect ELISA, flow cytometry analysis, and IFA; whereas 2F5 showed highest affinity with native antigen. 4B3 and 2F5 were therefore used to establish an antigen capture-ELISA (AC-ELISA) detection system. The sensitivity of this AC-ELISA was 3.95 TCID 50 /0.1 ml for WNV-infected cell culture supernatant. Notably, these MAbs showed no cross-reactivity with JEV, which suggests that they are useful for further development of highly sensitive, easy handling, and less time-consuming detection kits/tools in WNV surveillance in areas where JEV is epidemic. \n Title: Characterization and application of monoclonal antibodies specific to West Nile virus envelope protein\nStudent:", "result": "Teacher:In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

How much will it cost to buy their needed sheets of paper?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: If a cow drinks 80 liters of water in a day, it drinks 80 * 7 = 560 liters of water per week. Mr. Reyansh has 40 cows drinking 560 liters of water a week, totaling 560 * 40 = 22400 liters. In the ranch, a sheep drinks 1 / 4 * 80 = 20 liters of water in a day. The total amount of liters a sheep drinks in a week is 20 * 7 = 140 liters. Mr. Reyansh has ten times as many sheep as cows, that is 10 * 40 = 400 sheep.

The GOP is using a largely unknown but highly effective legislative tool that allows a simple majority in the House and Senate to overturn regulations that often took years to craft. Indeed, with an overhaul of health insurance going off the rails, Republicans are left pointing to the repeal of various government regulations as their crowning legislative achievement after some 70 days at work. The GOP casts the effort as overturning eight years of excessive government regulation and boosting business. “These things will help get people back to work, and after years of sluggish growth, give a real boost to our economy,” Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said this past week. The president has signed eight resolutions revoking regulations issued during the final months of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency. Six resolutions have cleared Congress and are awaiting the president’s signature. A couple dozen more are on deck, with last Thursday the deadline for filing more. Trump has signed measures eliminating requirements that mining and oil companies report payments made to foreign governments. The rule was designed to shine a light on how much money foreign governments received for their nation’s resources, thus reducing the prospect of corruption. He also signed another measure reversing an Obama plan to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. “These actions from Congress and the president are giving hope to businesses that they haven’t had in a long time,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi scoffed at the notion that Republicans were accomplishing anything with the regulatory repeals “because they do not meet the needs of the American people.” “They are about trickle-down. Their life is about giving more money to the high-end and to corporate interests, maybe it will trickle down, that would be good, but if it doesn’t, so be it, that’s the free market,” Pelosi said. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said the regulatory repeals Congress pushed through will actually damage the economy more than it helps. He said that eliminating the stream protection rule may help coal companies, but it hurts other companies that stand to gain through healthier streams and water supplies. “If you look across the terrain of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, they are repeals of public measures that help, consumers, workers and the environment in very substantial ways, but are opposed by powerful corporate interests,” Weissman said. “The Republicans driving these measures are paying back their corporate benefactors at the expense of the public.” In some cases, the regulatory repeal efforts have had nothing to do with the economy, but addressed hot-button social issues that so often dominate Washington politics. Republicans blocked a Social Security Administration rule that would have prevented tens of thousands of mentally disabled beneficiaries from being able to purchase a firearm. The rule was targeted specifically at those beneficiaries with mental disorders who have a third party manage their financial benefits, and it was opposed by the NRA and several advocacy groups for the disabled. The latest repeal effort clearing both chambers required Republicans to bring Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol so he could cast the tie-breaking vote on the abortion issue. The scrapping of the Health and Human Services rule gave states the go-ahead to deny federal family planning money to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. One of the more closely contested repeals would kill an online privacy regulation. Fifteen Republicans sided with Democrats in opposing the repeal, which Pelosi said would allow internet providers to sell personal information without a user’s consent. “You should be very, very scared,” she said. The ability of Congress to void regulations with a simple majority was created in 1996 when Congress passed the Congressional Review Act. In the 20 years since, Congress was only able to use it once to repeal a regulation. Congress sent five repeal resolutions to Obama, but he vetoed each of them. Trump made clear early on that he would back the efforts of the GOP-led Congress. “I will keep working with Congress, with every agency, and most importantly with the American people until we eliminate every unnecessary, harmful and job-killing regulation that we can find,” Trump said this past week. “We have a lot more coming.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has encouraged the regulatory rollbacks, weighing in with lawmakers on efforts affecting internet providers, federal contractors and energy companies. Neil Bradley, a senior vice president at the Chamber, acknowledges that it’s hard to say how many jobs are created or saved through the repeal of one particular rule, but he says employers of all sizes tell the chamber government regulations are a top concern that makes it harder for them to flourish. “Any time we can roll back these regulations is another step forward to restoring the economic growth that I think is the top priority of the American people,” Bradley said. ____ On Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking\n", "result": "Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

In the case, the Tax Court noted that this was the case in Georgia, the state involved. -The purpose of the retroactive dating cannot be to obtain an unwarranted tax benefit. The effective date of the rule will be 180 days from the date that it is published in the Federal Register, which was January 15, 2016. That makes it effective July 13, 2016.In order to answer \"What principle applies to retroactive effective dates in LLC's taxed as a partnership and when does a transfer of interest result in changes to income (loss) allocation for the involved members of the LLC according to the Tax Court case mentioned above?", "response": "In order to answer \"What principle applies to retroactive effective dates in LLC's taxed as a partnership and when does a transfer of interest result in changes to income (loss) allocation for the involved members of the LLC according to the Tax Court case mentioned above?", "elapsed": 111.14961004257202, "method": "./args/run_outs/honest_wt_15_0"}, {"prompt": "Corn is not chametz for Sephardic communities", "result": "Corn is not chametz for Sephardic communitiesCorn (maize/ma'as) is not considered chametz (lechem 'ain yisra'el/lechem m'um yisra'el/levi'atei yah/hamot/hamot yishm'ote/hamot yis'chalt'ote/hamot yism'chalt yishm'cholt/hamot yishm'cholt yishm'chol/hamot yishm'cholt yis'hachl/hamis/hamis yishm'cholt/ham'ach/ham'ach y", "response": "Corn (maize/ma'as) is not considered chametz (lechem 'ain yisra'el/lechem m'um yisra'el/levi'atei yah/hamot/hamot yishm'ote/hamot yis'chalt'ote/hamot yism'chalt yishm'cholt/hamot yishm'cholt yishm'chol/hamot yishm'cholt yis'hachl/hamis/hamis yishm'cholt/ham'ach/ham'ach y", "elapsed": 20.34695553779602, "method": "./args/run_outs/honest_wt_15_0"}, {"prompt": "Detailed Instructions: Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is the most fluent with respect to continuing the prompt.

Given that the number increased by 20% to give a value of 480, we can write this relationship as:\n\n(Original Number) * (1 + 0.20) = 480\n\nTo solve this equation and to simplify the left side, we can multiply both sides by the factor of (1/1 + 0.20):\n\n(Original Number) * 0.80 = 480 * 0.80\n\nNow we can divide both sides to solve for the Original", "response": "To solve this problem, we can first convert the percentage increase to a decimal and then use the basic percentage formula to find the original number.

Passage:The gens Sextia was a plebeian family at Rome, from the time of the early Republic and continuing into imperial times. The most famous member of the gens was Lucius Sextius Lateranus, who as tribune of the plebs from 376 to 367 BC, prevented the election of the annual magistrates, until the passage of the lex Licinia Sextia, otherwise known as the \"Licinian Rogations,\" in the latter year. This law, brought forward by Sextius and his colleague, Gaius Licinius Calvus, opened the consulship to the plebeians, and in the following year Sextius was elected the first plebeian consul. Despite the antiquity of the family, only one other member obtained the consulship during the time of the Republic.

Passage:After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the rivalry between Iran and Pakistan intensified. After 1989, both state's policies in Afghanistan became even more divergent as Pakistan, under Benazir Bhutto, explicitly supported Taliban forces in Afghanistan. This resulted in a major breach, with Iran becoming closer to India. Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Pakistani backed Taliban fought the Iranian backed Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and gained control of 90 percent of that country. As noted by a Pakistani foreign service officer, it was difficult to maintain good relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran at the same time, given Iran's long history of rivalry with these states. In 1995 Bhutto paid a lengthy state visit to Iran, which greatly relaxed relations. At a public meeting she spoke highly of Iran and Iranian society. However, increasing activity by Shia militants in Pakistan strained relations further. This was followed by the Taliban's capture of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, in which thousands of Shias were massacred, according to Amnesty International. The most serious breach in relations came in 1998, after Iran accused Taliban Afghanistan of taking 11 Iranian diplomats, 35 Iranian truck drivers and an Iranian journalist hostage, and later killing them all. Iran massed over 300,000 troops on the Afghan border and threatened to attack the Taliban government, which it had never recognized. This strained relations with Pakistan, as the Taliban were seen as Pakistan's key allies. In May 1998, Iran criticised Pakistan for its nuclear testing in the Chagai region, and held Pakistan accountable for global \"atomic proliferation\". New Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledged his country's nuclear capability on 7 September 1997.\n\n\nSOLUTION: b\n\nPROBLEM: Question: How many submarines were built in the same class as HMS Splendid?

After an initial patrol through the Bay of Biscay to Gibraltar, Splendid conducted two patrols in the Mediterranean Sea; one was abandoned after technical problems and on the other she sank two Italian ships. On her next patrol, the submarine attacked two Italian convoys, sinking an Italian destroyer in the second attack. Based in Algiers, the boat operated north of Sicily, sinking six Italian ships, including two tankers and two heavy merchant ships. Splendid was detected by a German destroyer on 21 April 1943 while patrolling off Naples, Italy; the submarine was attacked with depth charges by the destroyer and forced to surface, after which she was scuttled and her surviving crew members taken prisoner. She was the most successful British submarine by tonnage sunk between November 1942 and May 1943.\n\n\nSOLUTION:", "result": "TASK DEFINITION: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.
