Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words. Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n\nPart 2. Example\nContext word: fit. \nQuestion: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too large. \nAnswer: trophy.\nAnswer: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too small.\nExplanation: Here, replacing the trigger word \"large\" by its antonym \"small\" flips answer to the second object (\"suitcase\") in the question. So, this is a valid question.\nPart 3. Exercise\nContext Word: plant. \nQuestion: The plant was easier to take care of than the tree because the _ needed more attention. \nAnswer: tree.\nAnswer:The plant was more manageable and required less time and effort to keep it healthy and thriving, in comparison to the _ which needed a more dedicated and time-consuming care routine. \nExplanation: By replacing the trigger word \"tree\" with its antonym \"plant\", we flip the focus of attention in the question, leading us to compare and contrast the needs and maintenance required for each object, which are closely related and can be directly compared and evaluated on a similar scale. This is a well-crafted question, as it meets all the requirements mentioned in the definition, such as being factually coherent, context-appropriate, non-damaging,", "response": "The plant was more manageable and required less time and effort to keep it healthy and thriving, in comparison to the _ which needed a more dedicated and time-consuming care routine. \nExplanation: By replacing the trigger word \"tree\" with its antonym \"plant\", we flip the focus of attention in the question, leading us to compare and contrast the needs and maintenance required for each object, which are closely related and can be directly compared and evaluated on a similar scale.

Specific antibodies against infections most relevant to patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are not routinely evaluated in commercial polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations. A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses.

Specific antibodies against infections most relevant to patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are not routinely evaluated in commercial polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations. A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses. While donors were not selected for antibody titers other than against RSV, the immunoglobulin preparation had significantly higher titers to 6 of 7 viruses compared to those present in 10 commercially available therapeutic immunoglobulin products (p ≤ 0.01 to p ≤ 0.001).

The Dodger provides Oliver with a free meal and tells him of a gentleman in London who will \"give him lodgings for nothing, and never ask for change\". Grateful for the unexpected assistance, Oliver follows the Dodger to the \"old gentleman's\" residence. In this way Oliver unwittingly falls in with an infamous Jewish criminal known as Fagin, the gentleman of whom the Artful Dodger spoke. Ensnared, Oliver lives with Fagin and his gang of juvenile pickpockets in their lair at Saffron Hill for some time, unaware of their criminal occupations. He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs. \nQuestion: Who believes Fagin's gang make wallets and handkerchiefs?\nSolution: Oliver.\nExplanation: In the sentence \"He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs\", the pronoun \"he\" refers to name \"Oliver\".\n\nProblem: Passage: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \"seriously jeopardized financially\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad.  Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party.After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra's main conductor until his successor William Steinberg took up the post in 1959.  After the sudden resignation of Andrzej Panufnik from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959–60 season.

The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras.

We were headed for the beach and someone started singing the song Jesus loves me. As a 13-year-old girl, I was completely taken aback by their pure glee and abandon as they sang. I truly believed that Jesus loved them, but was just as certain that there was no way He loved me. I thought going to church was a big waste of time. I believed in God, but wasn’t sure about Jesus. Especially in my college years, I thought my parents were old and backwards and I was up and coming. When I argued with them about religion, my father would tell me how important it was to have faith in Christ. I wondered how someone as smart as my dad could believe in something so groundless. After marriage and especially after having kids, I began to contemplate the meaning of life. Was the meaning of life to be happy, avoid pain, make money, be nice to people, live somewhere beautiful? What was the point? I desperately needed to know the answer so I could guide my kids. I loved them so much and wanted more than anything in the world to teach them correctly. During the summers my children’s preschool offered a two-week vacation bible school and I signed up to do art projects. As the co-leader read from the bible I helped the kids dip a big scaly fish from the meat department at Randall’s into washable tempera paint and stamp its image onto a piece of construction paper. “Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves…” I don’t know about the kids, but feeding 5,000 people with two fish and some bread was impressive. Jesus was not just meek & humble he was also powerful. But one night, soon after that conversation, I drove around and cried out to Jesus. I told Him that I wanted to believe in Him and that I was so sorry for all the things that I had done wrong. I asked Him to please forgive me and to take my life and make it His. First, the Lord led me to church and to study the Bible. By His grace, He helped me give up a cigarette habit. Then, He gave me a way to help people going through hardship via Stephen Ministry. He wooed my husband to attend church, strengthened our marriage and gave us a desire to give of our resources to God’s work. He brought a Godly couple into our life to be mentors who connected us to ministries that reached out to high school kids and business professionals. He showed our children the way to find Him. Through the people at these ministries, God taught us how to pray and serve. He gave us Godly friends and brought us close to Himself. Most recently, the Lord provided an awesome missionary class called Perspectives and a mission trip to Haiti. It’s been thirteen years since the Lord gave my life meaning and purpose.

When I argued with them about religion, my father would tell me how important it was to have faith in Christ. I wondered how someone as smart as my dad could believe in something so groundless. After marriage and especially after having kids, I began to contemplate the meaning of life. Was the meaning of life to be happy, avoid pain, make money, be nice to people, live somewhere beautiful? What was the point? I desperately needed to know the answer so I could guide my kids. I loved them so much and wanted more than anything in the world to teach them correctly. During the summers my children’s preschool offered a two-week vacation bible school and I signed up to do art projects. As the co-leader read from the bible I helped the kids dip a big scaly fish from the meat department at Randall’s into washable tempera paint and stamp its image onto a piece of construction paper. “Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves…” I don’t know about the kids, but feeding 5,000 people with two fish and some bread was impressive. Jesus was not just meek & humble he was also powerful. But one night, soon after that conversation, I drove around and cried out to Jesus. I told Him that I wanted to believe in Him and that I was so sorry for all the things that I had done wrong. I asked Him to please forgive me and to take my life and make it His. First, the Lord led me to church and to study the Bible. By His grace, He helped me give up a cigarette habit. Then, He gave me a way to help people going through hardship via Stephen Ministry. He wooed my husband to attend church, strengthened our marriage and gave us a desire to give of our resources to God’s work. He brought a Godly couple into our life to be mentors who connected us to ministries that reached out to high school kids and business professionals. He showed our children the way to find Him. Through the people at these ministries, God taught us how to pray and serve. He gave us Godly friends and brought us close to Himself. Most recently, the Lord provided an awesome missionary class called Perspectives and a mission trip to Haiti. It’s been thirteen years since the Lord gave my life meaning and purpose. Life on earth is merely a story about God’s glory.After a long spiritual journey and personal introspection, the author finally found a deep and meaningful purpose in life through a strong and lasting Christian faith.

The regular tickets cost about $2000. As Travis is a student, he will get a 30% discount on this price. How much does he need to pay for his ticket?\n[Answer]The discount on the ticket is 30 / 100 * $2000 = $600. So Travis needs to pay $2000 - $600 = $1400. The answer is 1400.\nQ: Janet needs 5 tickets to ride the roller coaster and 3 tickets to ride the giant slide. How many tickets does she need to ride the roller coaster 7 times and the giant slide 4 times?\nA: First find how many tickets she needs for the roller coaster: 5 tickets / ride * 7 rides = 35 tickets. Then find how many tickets she needs for the giant slide: 3 tickets / ride * 4 rides = 12 tickets. Then add the number of tickets she needs for each ride to find the total number of tickets she needs: 12 tickets + 35 tickets = 47 tickets.

How many weeks will it take for Grace to get 1800 dollars?\nAnswer: Every two weeks, Grace will get 300 * 2 = 600 dollars. It will take Grace 1800 / 600 = 3 2 - week intervals to get 1800 dollars. It will take Grace 3 * 2 = 6 weeks in total. The answer is 6.\n[Question]Willie came back from Europe with 70 euros. Normally 5 euros is worth 1 dollar, but the money exchange at the airport will only give Willie 5/7ths of the official exchange rate. How many dollars does Willie get?\n[Answer]First first out how many euros Willie should have gotten using the official exchange rate: 70 euros / 5 euros / dollar = $14. Then multiply this quantity by 5 / 7 to find how many dollars he actually got: 14 dollars * 5 / 7 = $2 * 5 = $10. The answer is 10.\nQ: In a store, there are three types of cheese: white, swiss, and blue cheese. Each cheese is packaged, and there are 200 grams of cheese in each package. The package prices are $5 for white cheese, $6 for swiss cheese, and $8 for blue cheese. Miley needed to get some for her party, and she decided to buy 5 packs of swiss cheese, 600 grams of blue cheese, and one-third less white cheese. How much did she need to pay for all the cheese?\nA: For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $30. 600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = 3 packages. So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $24. One - third of the blue cheese means 1 / 3 * 600 = 200 grams. So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = 400 grams of white cheese. Which means 400 / 200 = 2 packages. So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $10. So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $64. The answer is 64.\nQuestion: Timothy and Theresa go to the movies very often. Timothy went to the movies 7 more times in 2010 that he did in 2009.

Does it have a recognizable, message, meaning, or moral? Does it touch upon themes? Are these demonstrated via actions, character arcs, and visual motifs?\n\nEmotion: Does your screenplay attempt to, and succeed in, evoking an emotional response from the audience? Do we feel a connection to your characters? Is the story memorable and unique? Is it worth reading or watching again?\n\nCharacter Traits: Are your characters well-developed and defined? Are they distinct from the other characters in your story? Are they relatable? Interesting?\n\nCharacter Goals: Do your characters have goals? Are the goals specific, attainable, and sufficiently difficult to achieve? Are there clear stakes for the characters should they fail to achieve their goals? Are the characters active in pursuit of their goals?\n\nCharacter Arcs: Do your characters have flaws or room for change in your story? Do your characters change over the course of your story? Does this change come about organically because of their journey? Are these arcs connected in some way to your themes?\n\nConflict: Is conflict present in every scene? Does the conflict relate to character goals? Does the conflict increase in intensity through the course of the story? Is the conflict strong with no obvious room for compromise?\n\nStory / Plot: Does your story make sense? Is it easy to follow? Do steps seem to be missing? Is the story as efficient as it could be? Do the scenes flow into one another? Are there random events that come out of nowhere? Are there plot threads that remain unresolved? Are there logical problems?\n\nVisual Storytelling: Is visual storytelling your only means of advancing the story? Does it not only advance the plot but also provide a sense of tone and mood?
